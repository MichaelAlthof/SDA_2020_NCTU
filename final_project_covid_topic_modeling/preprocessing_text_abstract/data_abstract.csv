Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal specimens of patients with confirmed COVID-19: A meta-analysis;Recent studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be found in fecal specimens of COVID-19 patients, but the sample size is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal specimens of these patients according to their clinical characteristics.
Common determinants of severe Covid-19 infection are explicable by SARS-CoV-2 secreted glycoprotein interaction with the CD33-related Siglecs, Siglec-3 and Siglec-5/14;SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the ACE-2 receptor cannot alone explain the demography and remarkable variation in clinical progression of Covid-19 infection.
High SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 patients;The seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was examined among 105 healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to four patients who were laboratory confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These HCWs were immediately under quarantine for 14 days as soon as they were identified as close contacts. The nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected on the first and 14
Could the D614G substitution in the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein be associated with higher COVID-19 mortality?;The increasing number of deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic has raised serious global concerns. Increased testing capacity and ample intensive care availability could explain lower mortality in some countries compared to others. Nevertheless, it is also plausible that the SARS-CoV-2 mutations giving rise to different phylogenetic clades are responsible for the apparent death rate disparities around the world. Current research literature linking the genetic make-up of SARS-CoV-2 with fatalities is lacking. Here, we suggest that this disparity in fatality rates may be attributed to SARS-CoV-2 evolving mutations and urge the international community to begin addressing the phylogenetic clade classification of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to clinical outcomes.
Antimalarial artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) and COVID-19 in Africa: ;At the end of November 2019, a novel coronavirus responsible for respiratory tract infections (COVID-19) emerged in China. Despite drastic containment measures, this virus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread in Asia and Europe. The pandemic is ongoing with a particular hotspot in Southern Europe and America
Diagnostic yield of repeat testing for SARS-CoV-2: Experience from a large health system in Los Angeles;To determine the diagnostic yield of repeat testing for SARS-CoV-2.
Computational analysis of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 surveillance by wastewater-based epidemiology locally and globally: Feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges;With the economic and practical limits of medical screening for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 coming sharply into focus worldwide, scientists are turning now to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a potential tool for assessing and managing the pandemic. We employed computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE. Depending on local conditions, detection in community wastewater of one symptomatic/asymptomatic infected case per 100 to 2,000,000 non-infected people is theoretically feasible, with some practical successes now being reported from around the world. Computer simulations for past, present and emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables. WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it. Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US$), depending on a nation's population size and number of testing rounds conducted. For resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance. Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations. Not compensating for temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/over-estimation of infected cases. Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots. Data provided here demonstrate this approach to save money, be broadly applicable worldwide, and potentially aid in precision management of the pandemic, thereby helping to accelerate the global economic recovery that billions of people rely upon for their livelihoods.
Serological immunochromatographic approach in diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 infected COVID-19 patients;An outbreak of new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was occurred in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other cities and nations. The standard diagnostic approach that widely adopted in the clinic is nucleic acid detection by real-time RT-PCR. However, the false-negative rate of the technique is unneglectable and serological methods are urgently warranted. Here, we presented the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic (ICG) strip targeting viral IgM or IgG antibody and compared it with real-time RT-PCR. The sensitivity of ICG assay with IgM and IgG combinatorial detection in nucleic acid confirmed cases were 11.1%, 92.9% and 96.8% at the early stage (1–7 days after onset), intermediate stage (8–14 days after onset), and late stage (more than 15 days), respectively. The ICG detection capacity in nucleic acid-negative suspected cases was 43.6%. In addition, the concordance of whole blood samples and plasma showed Cohen's kappa value of 0.93, which represented the almost perfect agreement between two types of samples. In conclusion, serological ICG strip assay in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection is both sensitive and consistent, which is considered as an excellent supplementary approach in clinical application.
Defensin 5 for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 invasion and Covid-19 disease;Corona virus disease 2019 (Covid-19), a pandemia emerged recently, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The receptor for corona virus and influenza A is the mucosal cell membrane protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant on the membrane of alveolar cells and enterocytes. Viral spike protein 1 (S1) is the ligand, with an affinity of 14.7 nM to the receptor. The main port of entry for the virus is the upper respiratory tract, and the diagnosis is usually by PCR of the viral RNA with nasal and pharyngeal swab test. Human defensin 5 (HDEF5) is a protein encoded by the DEFA gene, secreted by Paneth cells in the small intestine and by granules of neutrophils. It has an affinity of 39.3 nM to ACE2, much higher than that of the corona S1. HDEF5 may also attach to glycosylated Corona S1 protein, make its efficiency even better. The issues to be investigated are the affinity of HDEF5 to S1 protein, the ability of recombinant HDEF5 function in attaching both ACE2 and S1, and the feasibility to perform aerosol spray of this protein. In addition, safety and efficiency should be studied in phases I, II and II clinical protocols.
First known person-to-person transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the USA;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first detected in China in December, 2019. In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA.
Population-based seroprevalence surveys of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody: An up-to-date review;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to a global pandemic. However, the majority of currently available data are restricted to laboratory-confirmed cases for symptomatic patients, and the SARS-CoV-2 infection can manifest as an asymptomatic or mild disease. Therefore, the true extent of the burden of COVID-19 may be underestimated. Improved serological detection of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 could help estimate the true numbers of infections. This article comprehensively reviews the associated literature and provides updated information regarding the seroprevalence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. The seroprevalence can vary across different sites and the seroprevalence can increase with time during longitudinal follow-up. Although healthcare workers (HCWs), especially those caring for COVID-19 patients, are considered as a high-risk group, the seroprevalence in HCWs wearing adequate personal protective equipment is thought to be no higher than that in other groups. With regard to sex, no statistically significant difference has been found between male and female subjects. Some, but not all, studies have shown that children have a lower risk than other age groups. Finally, seroprevalence can vary according to different populations, such as pregnant women and hemodialysis patients
The spread of 2019-nCoV in China was primarily driven by population density. Comment on “Association between short-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 infection: Evidence from China” by Zhu et al.;Recently, an article published in the journal 
Longitudinal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profile and neutralization activity of a COVID-19 patient;We followed–up a mild COVID-19 patient for 91 days and serially monitored his serum antibodies to four SARS-CoV-2 related antigens (NP, RBD, S1 and ECD) and neutralization activities. Our data revealed a profile of serial antibody responses during the progress and a quick decline of neutralization activities after discharge.
Adjusting RT-qPCR conditions to avoid unspecific amplification in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic;The SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019 and quickly spread around the world forcing global health authorities to develop protocols for its diagnosis. Here we report dimer formation in the N2 primers-probe set (CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR) used in diagnostic routine, and propose alternatives to reduce dimerization events. Late unspecific amplifications were visualized in 56.4% and 57.1% of negative samples and no-template control, respectively, but not in positive samples and positive control. 
Clinical characteristics and changes of chest CT features in 307 patients with common COVID-19 pneumonia infected SARS-CoV-2: A multicenter study in Jiangsu, China;The study was aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and evaluate the dynamic changes of chest CT features in the first three weeks in the common type fo COVID-19 pneumonia patients in Jiangsu Province.
COVID-19 patients display distinct SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell responses according to disease severity;Adaptive Immune responses generated by SARS-CoV-2 virus in convalescent patients according to disease severity remain poorly characterized. To this end, we designed a prospective study (NCT04365322) that included 60 COVID-19 convalescent patients (1-month post infection) in two cohorts respectively entitled mild illness and severe pneumonia. The monitoring of peripheral immune responses was performed using IFNᵧ ELISpot assay. The serology index of each patient was investigated at the same time. Patients with severe pneumonia were older and had more comorbidities than patients with mild illness. T-cell responses in term of frequency and intensity were clearly distinct between mild illness and severe pneumonia patients. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that recent history of COVID-19 did not hamper viral memory T-cell pool against common viruses (Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr-virus and Flu-virus). The presence of potent adaptive immunity even in patients who underwent severe pneumonia sustain the rationale for the development of protective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.
Ketonuria with or without ketoacidosis as the presenting manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) among uncontrolled type 2 diabetic patients;We present three diabetic patients cases presented with kentonuria as the presenting manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
A genetic barcode of SARS-CoV-2 for monitoring global distribution of different clades during the COVID-19 pandemic;The SARS-CoV-2 pathogen has established endemicity in humans. This necessitates the development of rapid genetic surveillance methodologies to serve as an adjunct with existing comprehensive, albeit though slower, genome sequencing-driven approaches.
Field Evaluation of the Performance of a SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Diagnostic Test in Uganda using Nasopharyngeal Samples;There is a high demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing to identify COVID-19 cases. Real-time, quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) is the recommended diagnostic test but a number of constraints, including cost prevent its widespread implementation. The aim of this study was to evaluate a low cost, easy-to-use rapid antigen test for diagnosing COVID-19 at the point-of-care.
Spironolactone may provide protection from SARS-CoV-2: Targeting androgens, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS);In coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), four major factors have been correlated with worse prognosis: aging, hypertension, obesity, and exposure to androgen hormones. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) action are critical for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) cell entry and infectivity. ACE2 expression and RAAS are abnormal in hypertension and obesity, while TMPRSS2 is overexpressed when exposed to androgens, which may justify why these factors are overrepresented in COVID-19.
Understanding air and water borne transmission and survival of coronavirus: Insights and way forward for SARS-CoV-2;The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in unprecedented disease burden, healthcare costs, and economic impacts worldwide. Despite several measures, SARS-CoV-2 has been extremely impactful due to its extraordinary infection potential mainly through coronavirus-borne saliva respiratory and droplet nuclei of an infected person and its considerable stability on surfaces. Although the disease has affected over 180 countries, its extent and control are significantly different across the globe, making it a strong case for exploration of its behavior and dependence across various environmental pathways and its interactions with the virus. This has spurred efforts to characterize the coronavirus and understand the factors impacting its transmission and survival such as aerosols, air quality, meteorology, chemical compositions and characteristics of particles and surfaces, which are directly or indirectly associated with coronaviruses infection spread. Nonetheless, many peer-reviewed articles have studied these aspects but mostly in isolation
Current approaches in laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2;The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, has rapidly spread to produce a global pandemic. It is now clear that person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been occurring and that the virus has been dramatically growing in recent months. Early, rapid and accurate diagnosis is of great significance for curtailing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. There are currently several diagnostic techniques (e.g. viral culture and nucleic acid amplification test) being used to detect the virus. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these methods are quite different, with the sample source and detection limit varying greatly. This study reviewed all types and characteristics of the currently available laboratory diagnostic assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection and summarized the selection strategies of testing and sampling sites at different disease stages to improve the diagnostic accuracy of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Recreational waters – A potential transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 to humans?;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory illness caused by the novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has lead to high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide, has been causing major public health concerns since first detected in late 2019. Following identification of novel pathogens, questions in relation to dissemination of the pathogen and transmission routes begin to emerge. This rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 virus has been detected in both faecal and wastewater samples across the globe, highlighting the potential for faecal-oral transmission of the virus. As a result, concerns regarding the transmission of the virus in the environment and the risk associated with contracting the virus in recreational waters, particularly where inadequately treated wastewater is discharged, have been emerging in recent weeks. This paper highlights the need for further research to be carried out to investigate the presence, infectivity and viability of this newly identified SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater effluent and receiving recreational waters.
Effectiveness of isolation, testing, contact tracing, and physical distancing on reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in different settings: a mathematical modelling study;The isolation of symptomatic cases and tracing of contacts has been used as an early COVID-19 containment measure in many countries, with additional physical distancing measures also introduced as outbreaks have grown. To maintain control of infection while also reducing disruption to populations, there is a need to understand what combination of measures—including novel digital tracing approaches and less intensive physical distancing—might be required to reduce transmission. We aimed to estimate the reduction in transmission under different control measures across settings and how many contacts would be quarantined per day in different strategies for a given level of symptomatic case incidence.
SARS-CoV-2 and miRNA-like inhibition power;(1) Background: RNA viruses and especially coronaviruses could act inside host cells not only by building their own proteins, but also by perturbing the cell metabolism. We show the possibility of miRNA-like inhibitions by the SARS-CoV-2 concerning for example the hemoglobin and type I interferons syntheses, hence highly perturbing oxygen distribution in vital organs and immune response as described by clinicians
Serological cross-reactivity using a SARS-CoV-2 ELISA test in acute Zika virus infection, Colombia;We investigated seroreactivity by using a commercial SARS-CoV-2 ELISA test in samples collected from different groups of individuals, including patients diagnosed to have Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya infection between 2015 and 2019, from an endemic area in the Caribbean Colombian region.
The role of community-wide wearing of face mask for control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic due to SARS-CoV-2;Face mask usage by the healthy population in the community to reduce risk of transmission of respiratory viruses remains controversial. We assessed the effect of community-wide mask usage to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
Efficacy of a novel SARS-CoV-2 detection kit without RNA extraction and purification;Rapid detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and preventing the spread of the virus. A novel detection kit – the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit (nCoV-DK) – halves the detection time by eliminating the steps of RNA extraction and purification. We evaluated the concordance between the nCoV-DK and direct PCR. The virus was detected in 53/71 specimens (74.6%) by direct PCR and in 55/71 specimens (77.5%) by nCoV-DK
SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and impact on female genital tract: An untested hypothesis;COVID pandemic consists one of the most challenging medical realities. Apart from affecting respiratory system, current evidence has demonstrated multiorgan manifestations that SARS-Cov-2 infection may actually have. However, one of the medical hypotheses not yet thoroughly tested is the impact on female reproductive system and more specifically cervix. No large observational studies have been performed to test presence of SARS-Cov-2 in cervical samples, while potential correlation and impact on HPV infection has not yet been examined. In this context, our research team has already planned to begin a prospective observational study regarding detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in cervical cytology. The collected specimen will be analyzed for the presence of COVID-19 genetic material and in case of positive results, HPV typing will be performed as well in order to detect potential correlations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and HPV-infection. We would therefore like to launch our idea to control for SARS-CoV-2 infection in cervical specimen as well as examine potential correlation with HPV infection. Potential scientific proof of such hypothesis would change much regarding follow-up of HPV-positive patients while also triggering further research regarding aitiopathogenetic pathways of COVID. Communication of such a medical hypothesis could potentially motivate colleagues worldwide to expand their interest also on the research of SARS-CoV-2 cervical infection, in an effort to optimize our level of knowledge towards this new threatening and unknown reality of SARS-CoV-2.
Spillover of SARS-CoV-2 into novel wild hosts in North America: A conceptual model for perpetuation of the pathogen;There is evidence that the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is of animal origin. As with a number of zoonotic pathogens, there is a risk of spillover into novel hosts. Here, we propose a hypothesized conceptual model that illustrates the mechanism whereby the SARS-CoV-2 could spillover from infected humans to naive wildlife hosts in North America. This proposed model is premised on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human feces through municipal waste water treatment plants into the natural aquatic environment where potential wildlife hosts become infected. We use the existing literature on human coronaviruses, including SARS CoV, to support the potential pathways and mechanisms in the conceptual model. Although we focus on North America, our conceptual model could apply to other parts of the globe as well.
Risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2 in Antarctic wildlife;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This pathogen has spread rapidly across the world, causing high numbers of deaths and significant social and economic impacts. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus with a suggested zoonotic origin with the potential for cross-species transmission among animals. Antarctica can be considered the only continent free of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, concerns have been expressed regarding the potential human introduction of this virus to the continent through the activities of research or tourism to minimise the effects on human health, and the potential for virus transmission to Antarctic wildlife. We assess the reverse-zoonotic transmission risk to Antarctic wildlife by considering the available information on host susceptibility, dynamics of the infection in humans, and contact interactions between humans and Antarctic wildlife. The environmental conditions in Antarctica seem to be favourable for the virus stability. Indoor spaces such as those at research stations, research vessels or tourist cruise ships could allow for more transmission among humans and depending on their movements between different locations the virus could be spread across the continent. Among Antarctic wildlife previous in silico analyses suggested that cetaceans are at greater risk of infection whereas seals and birds appear to be at a low infection risk. However, caution needed until further research is carried out and consequently, the precautionary principle should be applied. Field researchers handling animals are identified as the human group posing the highest risk of transmission to animals while tourists and other personnel pose a significant risk only when in close proximity (< 5 m) to Antarctic fauna. We highlight measures to reduce the risk as well as identify of knowledge gaps related to this issue.
Self-reported loss of smell without nasal obstruction to identify COVID-19. The multicenter Coranosmia cohort study;To determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples in a subset of patients consulting for primarily isolated acute (<7 days) loss of smell and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of olfactory/gustatory dysfunction for COVID-19 diagnosis in the overall population tested for COVID-19 in the same period.
Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection and the risk for cancer;The current SARS-CoV-2 has put significant strain on healthcare services worldwide due to acute COVID-19. However, the potential long-term effects of this infection haven’t been extensively discussed.
Environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare premises;A large number of healthcare workers (HCWs) were infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs, patients, and visitors. No data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of Wuhan.
Air and surface contamination by SARS-CoV-2 virus in a tertiary hospital in Wuhan, China;Few studies have explored air and surface contamination by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in healthcare settings.
Pit latrines may be a potential risk in rural China and low-income countries when dealing with COVID-19;According to the latest reports, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was successfully isolated from the excreta (stool and urine) of COVID-19 patients, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted through excreta contaminated water. As pit latrines and the use of untreated excreta as fertilizer were common in rural China, we surveyed 27 villages of Jiangxi and Hubei provinces and found that pit latrines could be a potential source of SARS-CoV-2 water pollution. Recently, bats have been widely recognized as the source of SARS-CoV-2. There were many possible intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, including pangolin, snake, bird and fish, but which one was still not clear exactly. Here, we proposed a hypothesis to illustrate the mechanism that SARS-CoV-2 might spread from the excreta of infected humans in pit latrines to potential animal hosts, thus becoming a sustainable source of infection in rural China. Therefore, we believe that abolishing pit latrines and banning the use of untreated excreta as fertilizer can improve the local living environment and effectively prevent COVID-19 and other potential waterborne diseases that could emanate from the excreta of infected persons. Although this study focused on rural areas in China, the results could also be applied to low-income countries, especially in Africa.
Serum albumin-mediated strategy for the effective targeting of SARS-CoV-2;Novel coronavirus (NCoV-19), also known as SARS CoV-2, is a pathogen causing an emerging infection that rapidly increases in incidence and geographic range, is associated with the ever-increasing morbidity and mortality rates, and shows sever economic impact worldwide. The WHO declares the NCoV-19 infection disease (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and subsequently, on March 11, 2020, declared it a Global Pandemic. Although some people infected with SARS CoV-2 have no symptoms, the spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical, with most COVID-19 infections being not severe. The common mild symptoms include body aches, dry cough, fatigue, low-grade fever, nasal congestion, and sore throat. More severe COVID-19 symptoms are typical of pneumonia, and upon progression, the patient’s condition can worsen with severe respiratory and cardiac problems. Currently, there is no drug or vaccine for curing patients. It has been observed that people with challenged immunity are highly prone to SARS CoV-2 infection and least likely to recover. Also, older adults and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe forms of COVID-19. We are suggesting here a strategy for the COVID-19 treatment that could be effective in curing the patients in the current scenario when no efficient medicine or Vaccine is currently available, and Clinicians solely depend upon the performing trials with drugs with known antiviral activities. Our proposed strategy is based on the compilation of published scientific research and concepts. The different published research indicates the success of a similar strategy in different physiological conditions, and such a strategy is widely studied at the cellular level and in animal models.
The assessment of transmission efficiency and latent infection period in asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 infection;Few studies have focused on the transmission efficiency of asymptomatic carriers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Our follow-up study was performed on 147 asymptomatic carriers in Anhui Province. Of these, 50.0% were male, 50.3% were older than 40 years, 43.8% were farmers, and 68.7% were from the north of Anhui Province. 16 of the 147 asymptomatic carriers developed symptoms in the following 14 days of isolated observation, and were subsequently diagnosed as confirmed cases. The possible latent infection period was found to range from 1–5 days before onset, with a median time of 2 days. The second attack rate for the 16 confirmed cases who had transferred from being asymptomatic carriers was 9.7% (23/236 close contacts), while for the 131 asymptomatic carriers the rate was 2.6% (24/914 close contacts), showing a significant difference in second attack rate between the two groups (
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA residue on object surfaces in nucleic acid testing laboratory using droplet digital PCR;The rapid development of global COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge to the safety and quality of laboratory diagnostic testing. Little is known about the laboratory surface areas and operation behaviors that may cause potential contamination in SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing. This study aims to provide reference basis for the improvement of laboratory disinfection programs and personal operating protocols. In this study, we compared the qRT-PCR and ddPCR in detecting of residual virus that existed on the object surfaces from sample transportation and reception related facilities, testing related instruments, personal protective equipment and other facilities in nucleic acid testing laboratory. All samples were negative by qRT-PCR, in contrast, 13 of 61 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by ddPCR. The areas with highest density of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid were the outer gloves of operator A (37.4 copies/cm
Saliva is a reliable tool to detect SARS-CoV-2;This study analyzed salivary samples of COVID-19 patients and compared the results with their clinical and laboratory data.
NCAM protein and SARS-COV-2 surface proteins: In-silico hypothetical evidence for the immunopathogenesis of Guillain-Barré syndrome;This study aimed at identifying human neural proteins that can be attacked by cross-reacting SARS-COV-2 antibodies causing Guillain-Barré syndrome. These markers can be used for the diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). To achieve this goal, proteins implicated in the development of GBS were retrieved from literature. These human proteins were compared to SARS-COV-2 surface proteins to identify homologous sequences using Blastp. Then, MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes were determined in the homologous sequences and used for further analysis. Similar human and SARS-COV-2 epitopes were docked to the corresponding MHC molecule to compare the binding pattern of human and SARS-COV-2 proteins to the MHC molecule. Neural cell adhesion molecule is the only neural protein that showed homologous sequence to SARS-COV-2 envelope protein. The homologous sequence was part of HLA-A68 and HLA-DQA/HLA-DQB epitopes had a similar binding pattern to SARS-COV-2 envelope protein. Based on these results, the study suggests that NCAM may play a significant role in the immunopathogenesis of GBS. NCAM antibodies can be used as a marker for Guillain-Barré syndrome. However, more experimental studies are needed to prove these results.
DETECTION OF SARS-CoV-2 IN AIR OF TWO HOSPITAL IN HERMOSILLO, SONORA, MÉXICO, UTILIZING A LOW-COST ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING SYSTEM;The best way of preventing the dispersion of an infectious disease is decreasing of transmissibility of pathogen. To achieve such goal, it is important to have an epidemiological surveillance to retrieve data about its routes of transmission and dispersion.
Use of Weather Variables in SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Studies;The persistence and intensity of the current severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, and the advanced planning required to balance competing concerns of saving lives and avoiding economic collapse, may depend in part on whether the virus is sensitive to seasonal changes in environmental variables, such as temperature and humidity. Although multiple studies have sought to address possible effects of these variables on SARS–CoV-2 transmission, results of these studies have been varied. It is possible that at least some of the differing results are due to insufficient understanding of atmospheric science, including certain physical and chemical principles underlying selected meteorological variables, and how global seasons differ between tropical and temperate zones. The objective of this brief perspective is to provide information that may help explain some of the differing results of studies regarding the influence of environmental variables on transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. This information may promote better variable selection and results interpretation in future studies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other infectious diseases.
Estimating the infection-fatality risk of SARS-CoV-2 in New York City during the spring 2020 pandemic wave: a model-based analysis;As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, the infection-fatality risk (ie, risk of death among all infected individuals including those with asymptomatic and mild infections) is crucial for gauging the burden of death due to COVID-19 in the coming months or years. Here, we estimate the infection-fatality risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New York City, NY, USA, the first epidemic centre in the USA, where the infection-fatality risk remains unclear.
Case studies of SARS-CoV-2 treated with favipiravir among patients in critical or severe condition;The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is rising globally. However, clinically effective antiviral treatments are not established. Favipiravir may prevent pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome aggravation. We describe SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, two of whom were in a critical condition and one of whom was in a severe condition, who were administered favipiravir for their deteriorating conditions and cured.
Differential immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection in human lung and intestinal cells: Implications for treatment with IFN-β and IFN inducer;Respiratory and intestinal tract are two primary target organs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, detailed characterization of the host-virus interplay in infected human lung and intestinal epithelial cells is lacking.
Hydroxychloroquine as an aerosol might markedly reduce and even prevent severe clinical symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection;Covid-19 is a new coronavirus disease first described in December 2019. This respiratory illness is severe and potentially fatal. Severe cases make up to 15%, lethality ranges between 1.5 and more than 10%. What is urgently needed is an efficient pharmacological treatment for the treatment of severe cases. During the infection of alveolar epithelial cells of the lung, the ACE2 receptor has a central function. The antimalarial drugs chloroquine phosphate (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) impair in vitro the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 without significant change of cell-surface ACE2 and, therefore, might be potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Starting inhibition at 0.1 µM, CQ completely prevented in vitro infections at 10 µM, suggesting a prophylactic effect and preventing the virus spread 5 h after infection. In a first clinical trial, CQ was effective in inhibiting exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promotion of virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease. In addition, HCQ, which is three times more potent than CQ in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (EC50 0.72 µM), was significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Theoretically, CQ and HCQ could thus be effectively used in the treatment of SARS-CoV pneumonia. From a pharmacological standpoint, however, the major problems of oral treatment with these drugs are possible severe side effects and toxicity. Concretely, this relates to (a) the inconsistent individual bioavailability of these drugs at the alveolar target cells, depending on intestinal resorption, hepatic first-pass metabolism and accumulation in liver, spleen and lung, and (b) the need for a relatively high concentration of 1–5 µM at the alveolar surface.
Early SARS-CoV-2 outbreak detection by sewage-based epidemiology;Sewage can be used to determine the scale of COVID-19 outbreak. Sewage Epidemiology or Waste Based Epidemiology (WBE) approach has been successfully used to track and provide early warnings of outbreaks of pathogenic viruses such as Hepatitis A, Poliovirus and Norovirus. In untreated wastewater COVID-19 (excreted via faeces then introduced to wastewater) can survive from hours to days. Detection of COVID-19 can be carried out with nucleic acid−based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, used for confirmation of COVID-19 patients around the globe. New cheaper and faster monitoring tools are being developed to detect Covid-19 in wastewater by biosensors, ELISA, or paper-based indicator methods. This will allow to reveal true scale of Covid-19 outbreak associated with population link to a specific wastewater treatment plant.
Presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in isolation ward environment 28 days after exposure;Recent studies have reported that surfaces and objects in the rooms of infected patients that are frequently touched by both medical staff and patients could be contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. In December 2019, Wuhan China suffered the earliest from this COVID-19 pandemic, and we took that opportunity to investigate whether the SARS-CoV-2 RNA exists in the ward environment after a long time from exposure. We found that on the 28th day following the discharge of COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA could still be detected on the surfaces of pagers and in drawers in the isolation wards. Thorough disinfection of the ward environment was subsequently performed, after which these surfaces in the isolation wards tested negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The findings remind us that the contaminated environment in the wards may become potential infectious resources and that despite a long time from exposure, the thorough disinfection in the COVID-10 units after is still necessary.
Asymptomatic infection by SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers: A study in a large teaching hospital in Wuhan, China;To investigate the proportion and characteristics of asymptomatic infection among healthcare workers (HCWs).
Acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A co-infection in an Italian patient: Mini-review of the literature;A case of acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A co-infection and a mini-review of the literature is reported. Even in COVID-19 epidemics, the early identification of concurrent respiratory pathogens is important to improve etiological diagnosis, preventive measures and patients’ clinical management and outcome.
SARS-CoV-2-mediated encephalitis: Role of AT2R receptors in the blood-brain barrier;At the end of 2019, there was an outbreak of a new Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19 disease). Studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can cause infection in the central nervous system (CNS) and trigger neurological symptoms that include headache, nausea and vomiting, mental confusion and loss of smell or taste. These findings reveal that Coronaviruses have neurological tropism and neuroinvasive capacity. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain tissue possibly occurs through the systemic circulation as reported in patients affected by SARS-CoV. Evidence highlights similarity between the SARS-CoV genome and SARS-CoV-2 and that both interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) located in the brain tissue of infected patients. Hence, the presence of ACE2 is likely in the CNS to mediate the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into neural tissue. Our hypothesis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can cause encephalitis through the production of inflammatory mediators and activation of immune system cells resulting from the interaction of the ACE2 receptor with the viral Spike protein that causes an increase in angiotensin II. This mechanism has the ability to activate immune system cells by exacerbating stimuli at the angiotensin 2 receptor (AT2R). Thus, it leads to a status of brain injury preceded by vascular damage and destruction of the blood-brain barrier, making it responsible for the installation of acute inflammation.
Association between climate variables and global transmission oF SARS-CoV-2;In this study, we aimed at analyzing the associations between transmission of and deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 and meteorological variables, such as average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation. Two outcome measures were considered, with the first aiming to study SARS-CoV-2 infections and the second aiming to study COVID-19 mortality. Daily data as well as data on SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 mortality obtained between December 1, 2019 and March 28, 2020 were collected from weather stations around the world. The country's population density and time of exposure to the disease were used as control variables. Finally, a month dummy variable was added. Daily data by country were analyzed using the panel data model. An increase in the average daily temperature by one degree Fahrenheit reduced the number of cases by approximately 6.4 cases/day. There was a negative correlation between the average temperature per country and the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections. This association remained strong even with the incorporation of additional variables and controls (maximum temperature, average temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation) and fixed country effects. There was a positive correlation between precipitation and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Countries with higher rainfall measurements showed an increase in disease transmission. For each average inch/day, there was an increase of 56.01 cases/day. COVID-19 mortality showed no significant association with temperature.
Can preprocedural mouthrinses reduce SARS-CoV-2 load in dental aerosols?;Dental professionals work closely with patients and present an increased risk of person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the use of ultrasonic scalers, air-water syringes, and slow and high-speed handpieces, which are common in the dental office, generate spatter and aerosol. The use of preprocedural mouthrinses has been proposed to reduce the viral load in saliva and oropharyngeal tissues, thus decreasing viral load in dental aerosol. Although some mouthrinses demonstrates an antiviral effect, there is limited evidence about the clinical efficacy of any mouthrinse in the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the dental aerosol. We hypothesized that mouthrinses may reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the oropharynx and its fluids reducing viral load in dental aerosol. The potential use of mouthrinses is discussed, along with proposal of in vitro and clinical studies, in order to evaluate this hypothesis. If this hypothesis holds true, dental professionals and patients may benefit from the routine use of preprocedural mouthrinses.
On airborne transmission and control of SARS-Cov-2;The COVID-19 pandemic is creating a havoc situation across the globe that modern society has ever seen. Despite of their paramount importance, the transmission routes of SARS-Cov-2 still remain debated among various sectors. Evidences compiled here strongly suggest that the COVID-19 could be transmitted via air in inadequately ventilated environments. Existing experimental data showed that coronavirus survival was negatively impacted by ozone, high temperature and low humidity. Here, regression analysis showed that the spread of SARS-Cov-2 was reduced by increasing ambient ozone concentration level from 48.83 to 94.67 μg/m
The wastewater microbiome: A novel insight for COVID-19 surveillance;Wastewater-Based Epidemiology is a tool to face and mitigate COVID-19 outbreaks by evaluating conditions in a specific community. This study aimed to analyze the microbiome profiles using nanopore technology for full-length 16S rRNA sequencing in wastewater samples collected from a penitentiary (P), a residential care home (RCH), and a quarantine or health care facilities (HCF). During the study, the wastewater samples from the RCH and the P were negative for SARS-CoV-2 based on qPCRs, except during the fourth week when was detected. Unexpectedly, the wastewater microbiome from RCH and P prior to week four was correlated with the samples collected from the HCF, suggesting a core bacterial community is expelled from the digest tract of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. The microbiota of wastewater sample positives for SARS-CoV-2 was strongly associated with enteric bacteria previously reported in patients with risk factors for COVID-19. We provide novel evidence that the wastewater microbiome associated with gastrointestinal manifestations appears to precede the SARS-CoV-2 detection in sewage. This finding suggests that the wastewaters microbiome can be applied as an indicator of community-wide SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.
CCR5 Inhibition in Critical COVID-19 Patients Decreases Inflammatory Cytokines, Increases CD8 T-Cells, and Decreases SARS-CoV2 RNA in Plasma by Day 14;Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is now a global pandemic. Emerging results indicate a dysregulated immune response. Given the role of CCR5 in immune cell migration and inflammation, we investigated the impact of CCR5 blockade via the CCR5-specific antibody leronlimab on clinical, immunological and virological parameters in patients with severe COVID-19 disease.
Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in healthy adults aged 18–59 years: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial;With the unprecedented morbidity and mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, a vaccine against COVID-19 is urgently needed. We investigated CoronaVac (Sinovac Life Sciences, Beijing, China), an inactivated vaccine candidate against COVID-19, containing inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), for its safety, tolerability and immunogenicity.
Epidemic update of COVID-19 in Hubei Province compared with other regions in China;The COVID-19 outbreak spread in China and is a threat to the world. The aims of this study to help health workers better understand the epidemic of the COVID-19 and provide different control strategies toward Hubei Province and other regions in China.
Patterns of viral clearance in the natural course of asymptomatic COVID-19: Comparison with symptomatic non-severe COVID-19;The aim of this study was to elucidate patterns of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) clearance in the natural course of asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
A multiple therapy hypothesis for treatment of COVID-19 patients;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed more than one million people as of October 1, 2020. Consequently, a search is on for a treatment that can bring the pandemic to an end. However, treatments (vaccine, antiviral, plasma) that are directed at specific viral proteins (RNA polymerase, spike proteins) may not work well against all strains of the virus. Therefore, it is hypothesized that a therapy based on multiple treatments is needed for COVID-19 patients and to bring the pandemic to an end. Here, it is proposed that a combination of cool air therapy (CAT) and purified air technology (PAT) in an oxygen species cool air respirator (OSCAR) could be used to reduce viral (SARS-CoV-2) load and severity of illness in COVID-19 patients through the individual dose–response relationship. In addition, the proposed therapy (CAT + PAT in OSCAR), which works by a more general physical and chemical mechanism, should work well with other treatments (vaccine, antiviral, plasma) that target specific viral proteins (RNA polymerase, spike proteins) to provide a safe and effective multiple therapy approach for ending the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain (ENE-COVID): a nationwide, population-based seroepidemiological study;Spain is one of the European countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Serological surveys are a valuable tool to assess the extent of the epidemic, given the existence of asymptomatic cases and little access to diagnostic tests. This nationwide population-based study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain at national and regional level.
Prevalence of comorbidities and its effects in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review and meta-analysis;An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China
Unique fibrinogen-binding motifs in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS CoV-2: Potential implications in host-pathogen interactions;Novel Coronavirus (SARS CoV-2), the etiological agent for the highly contagious Corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has threatened global health and economy infecting around 5.8 million people and causing over 359,200 deaths (as of 28th May 2020, 
COVID-19 in an HIV-infected patient. Lessons learned from an autopsy case;Despite measures put in place to curb the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) across South Africa, there has been a rapid spread which caused extensive morbidity and mortality. Whilst there is currently increased COVID-19 associated death, autopsies on COVID positive individuals are not routinely performed. An autopsy was performed on a 19 years old African patient who was recently diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). He presented with clinical features suggestive of SARS-CoV-2, which he subsequently tested positive for. Important histopathological findings included diffuse alveolar damage and fibrin thrombi. No superimposed infections were noted. The cause of death was attributed to COVID-19. We report the first autopsy case of an HIV-infected individual with COVID-19 as the cause of death.
Acute onset olfactory/taste disorders are associated with a high viral burden in mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections;This study investigated, using cycle threshold (Ct) qPCR values, the association between symptoms and viral clearance in 57 patients with asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with olfactory/taste disorders (OTDs) exhibited lower qPCR Ct values and longer time to negative qPCR than those without OTDs, suggesting an association between OTDs and high viral burden.
Histopathology and ultrastructural findings of fatal COVID-19 infections in Washington State: a case series;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of an ongoing pandemic, with increasing deaths worldwide. To date, documentation of the histopathological features in fatal cases of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has been scarce due to sparse autopsy performance and incomplete organ sampling. We aimed to provide a clinicopathological report of severe COVID-19 cases by documenting histopathological changes and evidence of SARS-CoV-2 tissue tropism.
Ibuprofen, a traditional drug that may impact the course of COVID-19 new effective formulation in nebulizable solution;The traditional formulation of ibuprofen is poorly soluble in water, so the administered dose must be 10 times higher than the dose required for a therapeutic effect. The development of a hydrosoluble form of ibuprofen can be a strategy to reach a high concentration in the lungs by using modern inhalation devices. Therefore, the development of an inhalable formulation with high bioavailability in the lungs was the leitmotiv of our investigation. The hypertonic ibuprofen solution to be nebulized (NIH) presents great relevant characteristics: bactericidal, virucidal, mucolytic and has a known anti-inflammatory property. Bactericidal and virucidal effects are related to the physico-chemical properties of Na-ibuprofenate as an amphipathic molecule. It has the capability to insert into the bilayer membranes destabilizing the structure, altering its biological properties and avoiding the duplication or infection. Our preliminary results indicate that the presence of this high ionic strength solution reduces 10 times the amount of ibuprofen necessary to kill bacteria, but also the time to kill 1x10
Premises among SARS-CoV-2, dysbiosis and diarrhea: Walking through the ACE2/mTOR/autophagy route;Recently, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in China. Due to its high level of contagion, it has already reached most countries, quickly becoming a pandemic. Although the most common symptoms are related to breathing problems, SARS-CoV-2 infections also affect the gastrointestinal tract culminating in inflammation and diarrhea. However, the mechanisms related to these enteric manifestations are still not well understood. Evidence shows that the SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) in host cells as a viral invasion mechanism and can infect the lungs and the gut. Other viruses have already been linked to intestinal symptoms through binding to ACE2. In turn, this medical hypothesis article conjectures that the ACE2 downregulation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 internalization could lead to decreased activation of the mechanistic target of mTOR with increased autophagy and lead to intestinal dysbiosis, resulting in diarrhea. Besides that, dysbiosis can directly affect the respiratory system through the lungs. Although there are clues to other viruses that modulate the ACE2/gut/lungs axis, including the participation of autophagy and dysbiosis in the development of gastrointestinal symptoms, there is still no evidence of the ACE2/mTOR/autophagy pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Thus, we propose that the new coronavirus causes a change in the intestinal microbiota, which culminates in a diarrheal process through the ACE2/mTOR/autophagy pathway into enterocytes. Our assumption is supported by premises that unregulated intestinal microbiota increases the susceptibility to other diseases and extra-intestinal manifestations, which can even cause remote damage in lungs. These putative connections lead us to suggest and encourage future studies aiming at assessing the aforementioned hypothesis and regulating dysbiosis caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, in order to confirm the decrease in lung injuries and the improvement in the prognosis of the disease.
Airborne route and bad use of ventilation systems as non-negligible factors in SARS-CoV-2 transmission;The world is facing a pandemic of unseen proportions caused by a corona virus named SARS-CoV-2 with unprecedent worldwide measures being taken to tackle its contagion. Person-to-person transmission is accepted but WHO only considers aerosol transmission when procedures or support treatments that produce aerosol are performed. Transmission mechanisms are not fully understood and there is evidence for an airborne route to be considered, as the virus remains viable in aerosols for at least 3 h and that mask usage was the best intervention to prevent infection.
Dysimmunity and inflammatory storm: Watch out for bone lesions in COVID-19 infection;At the end of 2019, a new kind of pneumonia which was proven to be supported by novel coronaviruses named SARS-CoV-2 emerges and it seems to be more complicate in its clinical course and management. Related researches have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 serves roles in respiratory, intestinal and neuronal diseases. Given the growing cases of COVID-19, analyzing the relevance between COVID-19 and fragile patients who suffer from bone destruction is entirely indispensable. Accordingly, the recapitulatory commentary is necessary to advance our knowledge on COVID-19 and orthopedics. In this article, we particularly clarify the possible relationship between the newly COVID-19 infection and bone lesions from the standpoints of dysimmunity and inflammatory storm.
Arginine Depletion as a Therapeutic Approach for Patients with COVID-19;The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a source of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, and effective treatments are urgently needed. Clinical trials have largely focused on direct anti-viral therapies or on immunomodulation in patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19. One therapeutic approach that remains to be clinically investigated is disruption of the host-virus relationship through amino acid restriction, a strategy utilized successfully in the setting of cancer treatment. Arginine is an amino acid that has been shown in non-clinical studies to be essential in the life cycle of many viruses. As such, arginine depletion may represent an effective therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2. Several arginine-metabolizing enzymes in clinical development may represent a viable approach to induce a low arginine environment to treat COVID-19 and other viruses. Herein, we explore the rationale for arginine depletion as a therapeutic approach for COVID-19.
Low impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection among paediatric acute respiratory disease hospitalizations;This study describes the characteristics of children requiring admission with an acute lower-respiratory disease (ALRD) during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics.
Is the presence of lung injury in COVID-19 an independent risk factor for secondary lung cancer?;The morbidity and mortality of lung cancer are increasing. The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV-2, leading to subsequent pulmonary interstitial fibrosis with chronic inflammatory changes, e.g., inflammatory factors repeatedly continuously stimulating and attacking the alveolar epithelial cells. Meanwhile, 2019-nCoV-2 can activate PI3K/Akt and ERK signaling pathways, which can play the double roles as both anti-inflammatory and carcinogenic factors. Moreover, hypoxemia may be developed, resulting in the up-regulation of HIF-1 α expression, which can be involved in the occurrence, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis of lung cancer. Additionally, the immune system in 2019-nCoV-2 infected cases can be suppressed to cause tumor immune evasion. Therefore, we speculate that COVID-19 may be a risk factor of secondary lung cancer.
Temporal and age distributions of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, southeastern France;The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic presents a poorly understood epidemiological cycle. We aimed to compare the age and weekly distributions of the five human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, that circulated in southeastern France.
Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) of occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater treatment plants;The current global Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic has heightened calls for studies to evaluate respiratory exposure for wastewater treatment workers. In this global first study, we assess occupational health risks to wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) operators from inhalation of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 using a Quantitative Microbiological Risk Assessment (QMRA) framework. The following considerations were used to develop the QMRA and assess the illness risks to workers: a) the proportion of the population who are infected and thus responsible for shedding SARS-CoV-2 into raw wastewater
Association of COVID-19 pandemic with meteorological parameters over Singapore;Meteorological parameters are the critical factors affecting the transmission of infectious diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and influenza. Consequently, infectious disease incidence rates are likely to be influenced by the weather change. This study investigates the role of Singapore's hot tropical weather in COVID-19 transmission by exploring the association between meteorological parameters and the COVID-19 pandemic cases in Singapore. This study uses the secondary data of COVID-19 daily cases from the webpage of Ministry of Health (MOH), Singapore. Spearman and Kendall rank correlation tests were used to investigate the correlation between COVID-19 and meteorological parameters. Temperature, dew point, relative humidity, absolute humidity, and water vapor showed positive significant correlation with COVID-19 pandemic. These results will help the epidemiologists to understand the behavior of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus against meteorological variables. This study finding would be also a useful supplement to help the local healthcare policymakers, Center for Disease Control (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO) in the process of strategy making to combat COVID-19 in Singapore.
Safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: a preliminary report of a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial;The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be curtailed by vaccination. We assessed the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a viral vectored coronavirus vaccine that expresses the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.
A role of glycation and methylation for SARS-CoV-2 infection in diabetes?;Type-2 diabetes (T2D) is a major comorbidity of COVID-19, and poorly controlled diabetes is associated with high mortality rate, emphasizing the necessity to improve glycemic control. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor responsible for SARS-CoV-2 access to human cells, and ACE2 expression is increased in patients with diabetes and hypertension treated with ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. We hypothesize that an upregulation of ACE2 due to its non-enzymatic glycation could be considered, as well as a change of the protein tertiary structure in terms of amino acid (mostly lysine) available to be glycated. In fact, in a single ACE2 molecule, 34 lysine residues are present in the extracellular portion, and at least one of these is co-involved in a fundamental hydrogen-bond interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). The worse outcome of COVID-19 in people with diabetes could be related to the non-enzymatic glycation that triggers the activity of ACE2. Moreover, DNA methylation of genes regulating islet beta-cell function, as well as in insulin resistance of peripheral tissues such as liver, muscle, and adipose tissue may be involved, as already demonstrated for cancer conditions. DNA methylation, besides being considered as a biomarker to predict the risk of obesity and T2D, has been suggested also as a target for dietary and pharmacological treatments. The present observations may suggest further interventions in order to improve the outcome of COVID-19 in people affected by diabetes.
COVID-19: Disease, management, treatment, and social impact;COVID-19 was originated from Wuhan city of Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since then it has spread in more than 210 countries and territories. It is a viral disease due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The patients show flu-like symptoms with a dry cough, sore throat, high fever, and breathing problems. The disease due to SARS-CoV-2 was named as COVID-19. About 2.2 million people have been infected with more than 0.15 million deaths globally. The United States of America is the most affected country with the highest patients of about 0.7 million. Despite great efforts, there is no treatment of this disease. However, prevention and management are the best options. This article describes SARS-CoV-2, disease, prevention and management, treatment and social impact on society. It was analyzed that a combination of antiviral drugs with hydroxyl-chloroquine and azithromycin (with the consultation of a medical practitioner) may be the best option to treat the patients, depending on the patient's conditions and symptoms. However, Unani therapy may be useful along with allopathic treatment. It is urgently advised and requested that all the persons should follow the preventive measures, managements and quarantine strictly without any religious discrepancy otherwise the situation may be the worst. Also, there is an urgent requirement to educate our new generation for science and technology to fight against any such disaster in future
Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 with high dose oral zinc salts: A report on four patients;Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with substantial mortality and no accepted therapy. We report here on four consecutive outpatients with clinical characteristics (CDC case definition) of and/or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were treated with high dose zinc salt oral lozenges. All four patients experienced significant improvement in objective and symptomatic disease measures after one day of high dose therapy suggesting that zinc therapy was playing a role in clinical recovery. A mechanism for zinc’s effects is proposed based on previously published studies on SARS- CoV-1, and randomized controlled trials assessing zinc shortening of common cold duration. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the effectiveness of zinc as a treatment for COVID-19 but suggest the variables to be addressed to confirm these initial findings in future trials.
Clinical characteristics of critically ill patients co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the influenza virus in Wuhan, China;To delineate the clinical characteristics of critically ill COVID-19 patients co-infected with influenza.
SARS-CoV-2-related mortality in a rural Latin American population;A sudden increase in adult mortality associated with respiratory diseases was noticed in Atahualpa (a rural Ecuadorian village), coinciding with the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the region. From a total of 1,852 individuals aged ≥18 years, 40 deaths occurred between January and June, 2020. In addition, a seroprevalence survey showed that 45% of the adult population have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Verbal autopsies revealed SARS-CoV-2 as the most likely cause of death in 29 cases. The mean age of suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases was 76.9 ± 12.1 years, while that of those dying from unrelated causes was 60.3 ± 20.4 years (
Nerve conduction study and electromyography findings in patients recovering from Covid-19 – case report;Three patients with recent sequelae after Corona Virus Disease (COVID)-19 such as fatigue and myalgia of both calves were submitted to electrophysiological examinations, nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG). NCS shows, as common elements, the presence of a partial or complete conduction block on several nerves, slightly prolonged latency of the tibial nerve, and rare or absent F-waves, all suggesting a demyelinating polyneuropathy due to SARS-COV-2. The short duration and low amplitude of the motor unit action potential with early full recruitment on interference pattern on EMG, typical for myopathy, suggest a direct action of COVID 19 on muscular fibers, especially in the lower limbs.
Tackling the COVID-19 “cytokine storm” with microRNA mimics directly targeting the 3’UTR of pro-inflammatory mRNAs;COVID-19 is characterized by two major clinical phases, the SARS-CoV-2 infection of target cells and tissues, and a deep inflammatory state, known as “cytokine storm”, caused by activation of pro-inflammatory genes, such as NF-kB, STAT-3, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1ß. Among possible anti-inflammatory agents, the “microRNA targeting” should be carefully considered, since it is well known that microRNAs are deeply involved in the expression of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. The working general hypothesis is that targeting of the microRNA network might be important for the development of therapeutic approaches to counteract the COVID-19 induction of inflammatory response. This hypothesis is based on several publications demonstrating the use of miRNA mimics for inhibitory functions on the production of proteins characterizing the COVID-19 “cytokine storm”.
Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a large nationwide sample of patients on dialysis in the USA: a cross-sectional study;Many patients receiving dialysis in the USA share the socioeconomic characteristics of underserved communities, and undergo routine monthly laboratory testing, facilitating a practical, unbiased, and repeatable assessment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence.
SARS-CoV-2 and viral sepsis: observations and hypotheses;Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), clinicians have tried every effort to understand the disease, and a brief portrait of its clinical features have been identified. In clinical practice, we noticed that many severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients developed typical clinical manifestations of shock, including cold extremities and weak peripheral pulses, even in the absence of overt hypotension. Understanding the mechanism of viral sepsis in COVID-19 is warranted for exploring better clinical care for these patients. With evidence collected from autopsy studies on COVID-19 and basic science research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV, we have put forward several hypotheses about SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis after multiple rounds of discussion among basic science researchers, pathologists, and clinicians working on COVID-19. We hypothesise that a process called viral sepsis is crucial to the disease mechanism of COVID-19. Although these ideas might be proven imperfect or even wrong later, we believe they can provide inputs and guide directions for basic research at this moment.
Fate of respiratory droplets in tropical vs temperate environments and implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission;The new pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has shown stark differences in number of affected patients between countries in the tropics and those with temperate environments. Though there have been many theories on reasons for these differences, we hypothesise that this could be due to differences in the fate of respiratory droplets in the two environments. A simple understanding of the mechanics of droplet size, dispersion and displacement could help infection control and public health measures to minimize spread and mitigate the risk of people getting infected especially in hotspots like hospital environments or other closed spaces. This paper discusses the possibility of differences in number of infections and spread between different countries based on the spread of droplets.
Novel therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2-induced acute lung injury: Targeting a potential IL-1β/neutrophil extracellular traps feedback loop;Most COVID-19 infected individuals present with mild flu-like symptoms
SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed only by cell culture isolation before the local outbreak in an Italian seven-week-old suckling baby;SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in December 2019 and has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. This paper described the case of a 7-week-old suckling baby from Italy who was SARS-CoV-2-positive only by the cell culture method, with no clinical suspicion of and/or risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The baby was referred to hospital, with signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, before the virus had spread to the province. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs and a nasopharyngeal aspirate were used for conventional and molecular diagnostic assays not including the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Bacteria referred to the resident population were revealed in nasal and pharyngeal swabs. No viruses were detected using both immunofluorescence assay and nucleic acid amplification assays in the nasopharyngeal aspirate. The baby was discharged in good condition after 3 days of hospitalisation. Later, a cytopathic effect on the cell monolayers currently used for respiratory viruses was observed and the viral particles were identified as 
Benchmarking virus concentration methods for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater;Wastewater-based epidemiology offers a cost-effective alternative to testing large populations for SARS-CoV-2 virus, and may potentially be used as an early warning system for SARS-CoV-2 pandemic spread. However, viruses are highly diluted in wastewater, and a validated method for their concentration and further processing, and suitable reference viruses, are the main needs to be established for reliable SARS-CoV-2 municipal wastewater detection. For this purpose, we collected wastewater from two European cities during the Covid-19 pandemic and evaluated the sensitivity of RT-qPCR detection of viral RNA after four concentration methods (two variants of ultrafiltration-based method and two adsorption and extraction-based methods). Further, we evaluated one external (bovine corona virus) and one internal (pepper mild mottle virus) reference virus. We found a consistently higher recovery of spiked virus using the modified ultrafiltration-based method. This method also had a significantly higher efficiency (
COVID-19 and sickle cell disease in Bahrain;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a newly identified strain of the coronavirus family that has been shown to affect the hemoglobin beta chain, the same chain that has sickle cell disease (SCD) mutation. This study was undertaken to see if COVID-19 infection increased disease severity in patients with SCD.
From SARS to COVID-19: What we have learned about children infected with COVID-19;Coronaviruses, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, first appeared in China. They have certain biological, epidemiological and pathological similarities. To date, research has shown that their genes exhibit 79% of identical sequences and the receptor-binding domain structure is also very similar. There has been extensive research performed on SARS
Comparison of molecular testing strategies for COVID-19 control: a mathematical modelling study;WHO has called for increased testing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but countries have taken different approaches and the effectiveness of alternative strategies is unknown. We aimed to investigate the potential impact of different testing and isolation strategies on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Effects of a major deletion in the SARS-CoV-2 genome on the severity of infection and the inflammatory response: an observational cohort study;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with a 382-nucleotide deletion (∆382) in the open reading frame 8 (ORF8) region of the genome have been detected in Singapore and other countries. We investigated the effect of this deletion on the clinical features of infection.
Temporal profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks. Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.
Viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers and presymptomatic patients;From a total of 71 laboratory-confirmed cases, three presymptomatic patients and 10 patients with entirely asymptomatic infections were identified. In two of the three incubation period patients, the viral titer in the presymptomatic period was very high (Ct value < 20). The median number of days to first negative RT-PCR in the asymptomatic carriers was 4.5 (range 2.5–9), and all asymptomatic carriers reached a first RT-PCR Ct > 35 within 14 days after diagnosis. Patients who have COVID-19 may already be infectious before there are symptoms, and 14 days of isolation after diagnosis may be sufficient in entirely asymptomatic cases.
Distinguishing between typical Kawasaki disease and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2;In recent months, there are increasing reports of a Kawasaki disease-like syndrome in children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), termed ‘Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS)’ in the UK. Debate is ongoing regarding the nature of these pro-inflammatory syndromes. We herein propose that the platelet count may, at least in part, be able to help us differentiate between the two aforementioned syndromes. In a recent report, compared to a historical ‘classical’ Kawasaki disease (KD) cohort, patients with PIMS-TS had significantly lower platelet counts (188 vs 383 g/L, p < 0.0001). A possible explanation for this is their difference in underlying immunopathogenesis. In KD, the fundamental pathogenesis is thought to be immune complex-mediated, hence, the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) which competes with the immunoglobulin Fc receptors (FcRs) on inflammatory cells, preventing the activation of these cells and thereby ameliorating the inflammatory response. If left untreated, these immune complexes activates the inflammatory cells (including monocytes and neutrophils), which also results in recruitment of platelets, resulting in the thrombocytosis we commonly see in KD. These immune complexes may also bind to platelets directly via FcRs on platelet membranes. In contrast, in viral-associated hyperinflammatory syndromes (e.g. PIMS-TS or MIS-C), there are mediators being secreted in the process of eradication of the virus (mainly to stimulate CD8+ cells to kill viral infected cells), which would inadvertently suppress bone marrow function and activate platelets, culminating in thrombocytopenia.
Active case finding with case management: the key to tackling the COVID-19 pandemic;COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020, the first non-influenza pandemic, affecting more than 200 countries and areas, with more than 5·9 million cases by May 31, 2020. Countries have developed strategies to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic that fit their epidemiological situations, capacities, and values. We describe China's strategies for prevention and control of COVID-19 (containment and suppression) and their application, from the perspective of the COVID-19 experience to date in China. Although China has contained severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and nearly stopped indigenous transmission, a strong suppression effort must continue to prevent re-establishment of community transmission from importation-related cases. We believe that case finding and management, with identification and quarantine of close contacts, are vitally important containment measures and are essential in China's pathway forward. We describe the next steps planned in China that follow the containment effort. We believe that sharing countries' experiences will help the global community manage the COVID-19 pandemic by identifying what works in the struggle against SARS-CoV-2.
An influenza A(H3N2) virus outbreak during the COVID-19 pandemic, Kingdom of Cambodia, 2020;Coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, global influenza virus circulation decreased, possibly due to widespread community mitigation measures. Cambodia eased some COVID-19 mitigation measures in June and July 2020. On Aug 20th a cluster of respiratory illnesses among residents of a pagoda included persons that had tested positive for influenza A, and none that were positive for SARS-CoV-2.
EMMPRIN/BASIGIN as a biological modulator of oral cancer and COVID-19 interaction: Novel propositions;Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), which is also called BASIGIN/CD147, is a cell surface glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and plays a significant role in intercellular recognition in immunology, cellular differentiation and development. Apart from ACE-2, recently EMMPRIN, has been regarded as a target for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) attachment and entry into the host cell. Since one of the routes of entry for the virus is the oral cavity, it becomes imperative to percept oral comorbidities such oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) in terms of EMMPRIN as a target for SARS-CoV-2. In the present paper, it is proposed that OSCC, by the virtue of upregulation of EMMPRIN expression, increases the susceptibility to coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In turn, COVID-19 in OSCC patients causes exhaustion of EMMPRIN receptor due to binding with ‘S’ receptor leading to a downregulation of related carcinogenesis events. We proposed that in the ACE-2 depleted situation in OSCC, EMMPRIN receptor might get high jacked by the COVID-19 virus for the entry into the host cells. Apart from the anti-monoclonal antibody, it is recommended to explore the use of grape seed and skin containing mouthwash as an adjunct, which could also have anti EMMPRIN effects in patients with OSCC and OPMDs.
Inhaled route and anti-inflammatory action of ivermectin: Do they hold promise in fighting against COVID-19?;In an effort to curb the global pandemic due to coronavirus, the scientific community is exploring various treatment strategies with a special emphasis on drug repurposing. Ivermectin, an anti-helminthic drug is also being proposed for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Ivermectin has demonstrated broad spectrum antiviral activity against both DNA and RNA viruses. Due to its potential to interfere with transport of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein to nucleus, it is being proposed to have antiviral activity against this virus as well which has been confirmed in an in-vitro study. However, in-vitro to in-vivo extrapolation studies indicate an inability to achieve the desired IC50 levels of ivermectin after oral administration of doses up to 10 times higher than the approved anti-helminthic dose. In a modelling simulation study, drug accumulation in the lungs was noticed at levels having potential antiviral activity. It is hypothesised that inhaled formulation of ivermectin may be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, ivermectin administered via inhalational route needs to be explored for potential beneficial role in COVID-19 in preclinical and clinical studies. We also hypothesise the possibility of drug having anti-inflammatory action in coronavirus associated severe respiratory illness based on few in-vitro and in-vivo reports which however needs to be confirmed clinically.
Facemasks in the COVID-19 era: A health hypothesis;Many countries across the globe utilized medical and non-medical facemasks as non-pharmaceutical intervention for reducing the transmission and infectivity of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Although, scientific evidence supporting facemasks’ efficacy is lacking, adverse physiological, psychological and health effects are established. Is has been hypothesized that facemasks have compromised safety and efficacy profile and should be avoided from use. The current article comprehensively summarizes scientific evidences with respect to wearing facemasks in the COVID-19 era, providing prosper information for public health and decisions making.
A new pharmacological approach based on remdesivir aerosolized administration on SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary inflammation: A possible and rational therapeutic application;The new zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus not previously seen in humans and which appears to come from bat species. It originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world, causing over 5,569,679 global cases and 351,866 deaths in almost every country in the world, including Europe, particularly Italy. In general, based on existing data published to date, 80.9% of patients infected with the virus develop mild infection
: A synchronized whole-of-world approach for COVID-19 mitigation;The COVID-19 pandemic can no longer be mitigated by a nationwide approach of individual nations alone. Given its scale and accelerating expansion, COVID-19 requires a coordinated and simultaneous Whole- of-World approach that galvanizes clear global leadership and solidarity from all governments of the world. Considering an ‘all hands-on deck’ concept, we present a comprehensive list of tools and entities responsible for enabling them, as well a conceptual framework to achieve the maximum impact. The list is drawn from pandemic mitigation tools developed in response to past outbreaks including influenza, coronaviruses, and Ebola, and includes tools to minimize transmission in various settings including person-to-person, crowd, funerals, travel, workplace, and events and gatherings including business, social and religious venues. Included are the roles of individuals, communities, government and other sectors such as school systems, health, institutions, and business. While individuals and communities have significant responsibilities to prevent person-to-person transmission, other entities can play a significant role to enable individuals and communities to make use of the tools. Historic and current data indicate the role of political will, whole-of-government approach, and the role of early introduction of mitigation measures. There is also an urgent need to further elucidate the immunologic mechanisms underlying the epidemiological characteristics such as the low disease burden among women, and the role of COVID-19 in inducing Kawasaki-like syndromes in children. Understanding the role of and development of anti-inflammatory strategies based on our understanding of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1, IL-6) is also critical. Similarly, the role of oxygen therapy as an anti-inflammatory strategy is evident and access to oxygen therapy should be prioritized to avoid the aggravation of COVID-19 infection. We highlight the need for global solidarity to share both mitigation commodities and infrastructure between countries. Given the global reach of COVID-19 and potential for repeat waves of outbreaks, we call on all countries and communities to act synergistically and emphasize the need for synchronized pan-global mitigation efforts to minimize everyone's risk, to maximize collaboration, and to commit to shared progress.
Environment and COVID-19: Pollutants, impacts, dissemination, management and recommendations for facing future epidemic threats;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. Its relationship with environmental factors is an issue that has attracted the attention of scientists and governments. This article aims to deal with a possible association between COVID-19 and environmental factors and provide some recommendations for adequately controlling future epidemic threats. Environmental management through ecosystem services has a relevant role in exposing and spreading infectious diseases, reduction of pollutants, and control of climatic factors. Pollutants and viruses (such as COVID-19) produce negative immunological responses and share similar mechanisms of action. Therefore, they can have an additive and enhancing role in viral diseases. Significant associations between air pollution and COVID-19 have been reported. Particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) can obstruct the airway, exacerbating cases of COVID-19. Some climatic factors have been shown to affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Yet, it is not well established if climatic factors might have a cause-effect relationship to the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. So far, positive as well as negative indirect environmental impacts have been reported, with negative impacts greater and more persistent. Too little is known about the current pandemic to evaluate whether there is an association between environment and positive COVID-19 cases. We recommend smart technology to collect data remotely, the implementation of “one health” approach between public health physicians and veterinarians, and the use of biodegradable medical supplies in future epidemic threats.
Assessing the relationship between surface levels of PM2.5 and PM10 particulate matter impact on COVID-19 in Milan, Italy;The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly pathogenic, transmittable and invasive pneumococcal disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in December 2019 and January 2020 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China and fast spread later on the middle of February 2020 in the Northern part of Italy and Europe.
COVID-19 and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS): A spark that sets the forest alight?;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased exponentially in numbers with more than 20 million people infected around the globe. It is clear that COVID-19 is not a simple viral pneumonia, but presents with unusual pathophysiological effects. Of special interest is that SARS-CoV-2 utilises the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) for cell entry and therefore has a direct effect on the renin angiotensin system (RAS). The RAS is primarily responsible for blood pressure control via the classic pathway. Recently numerous other pathological processes have been described due to stimulation of this classic pathway. There is also a protective RAS pathway medicated by ACE2 which may be suppressed in COVID-19. This leads to overstimulation of the classic pathway with adverse cardiovascular and respiratory effects, hypercoagulation, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and insulin resistance. We hypothesize that overreaction of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone may account for the myriad of unusual biochemical and clinical abnormalities noted in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Combating hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients with a natural oxygen carrier, HEMO;Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the COVID-19 crisis affecting the whole world. This virus can provoke acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to overcrowed the intensive care unit (ICU). Over the last months, worldwide experience demonstrated that the ARDS in COVID-19 patients are in many ways “atypical”. The mortality rate in ventilated patients is high despite the application of the gold standard treatment (protective ventilation, curare, prone position, inhaled NO). Several studies suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 could interact negatively on red blood cell homeostasis. Furthermore, SarsCov2 creates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are toxic and generate endothelial dysfunction. Hypothesis/Objective(s)
Monitoring approaches for health-care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic;Health-care workers are crucial to any health-care system. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, health-care workers are at a substantially increased risk of becoming infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and could come to considerable harm as a result. Depending on the phase of the pandemic, patients with COVID-19 might not be the main source of SARS-CoV-2 infection and health-care workers could be exposed to atypical patients, infected family members, contacts, and colleagues, or live in communities of active transmission. Clear strategies to support and appropriately manage exposed and infected health-care workers are essential to ensure effective staff management and to engender trust in the workplace. These management strategies should focus on risk stratification, suitable clinical monitoring, low-threshold access to diagnostics, and decision making about removal from and return to work. Policy makers need to support health-care facilities in interpreting guidance during a pandemic that will probably be characterised by fluctuating local incidence of SARS-CoV-2 to mitigate the impact of this pandemic on their workforce.

Severe immune thrombocytopenia in a critically ill COVID-19 patient;The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 can cause a severe and even fatal respiratory illness named COVID-19. Apart from respiratory failure, COVID-19 may be associated with various autoimmune complications. We present a case of a critically ill patient with COVID-19 who developed severe immune thrombocytopenia that was successfully treated with a concomitant use of corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulins.
The estimation of diagnostic accuracy of tests for COVID-19: A scoping review;To assess the methodologies used in the estimation of diagnostic accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and other nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and to evaluate the quality and reliability of the studies employing those methods.
Impact of building ventilation systems and habitual indoor incense burning on SARS-CoV-2 virus transmissions in Middle Eastern countries;Majority of countries across the globe have employed improving building ventilation, quarantine, social distancing, and disinfections as a general measure of preventing SARS-CoV-2 virus transmissions. However, arid Middle Eastern countries with hot climate (elevated outdoor temperature and humidity levels) are experiencing a different situation. Unfortunately, these harsh ambient climatic conditions in Middle Eastern countries make it impossible for most buildings to utilize natural/mechanical ventilation systems. Besides, indoor air temperatures of most buildings are very low due to overconsumption of air conditioning, thereby, it can be a potential factor of virus spread in most residential homes and public buildings. Most importantly, habitual indoor burning of incense which is the major source of coarse (PM
Role of favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19;The COVID-19 outbreak all over the world has led the researchers to strive for developing drugs or vaccines to prevent or halt the progression of this ailment. To hasten the treatment process, repurposed drugs are being evaluated. Favipiravir is one such oral drug that was approved for new and re-emerging pandemic influenza in Japan in 2014 and has shown potent 
Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) cytoprotective pathway: A potential treatment strategy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced cytokine storm syndrome;The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires urgent need for effective treatment. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by a cytokine storm syndrome with subsequent multiple organ failure (MOF) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may lead to intensive care unit and increased risk of death.
The AI-discovered aetiology of COVID-19 and rationale of the irinotecan+ etoposide combination therapy for critically ill COVID-19 patients;We present the AI-discovered aetiology of COVID-19, based on a precise disease model of COVID-19 built under five weeks that best matches the epidemiological characteristics, transmission dynamics, clinical features, and biological properties of COVID-19 and consistently explains the rapidly expanding COVID-19 literature. We present that SARS-CoV-2 implements a unique unbiased survival strategy of balancing viral replication with viral spread by increasing its dependence on (i) ACE2-expressing cells for viral entry and spread, (ii) PI3K signaling in ACE2-expressing cells for viral replication and egress, and (iii) viral- non-structural-and-accessory-protein-dependent immunomodulation to balance viral spread and viral replication. We further propose the combination of irinotecan (an in-market topoisomerase I inhibitor) and etoposide (an in-market topoisomerase II inhibitor) could potentially be an exceptionally effective treatment to protect critically ill patients from death caused by COVID-19-specific cytokine storms triggered by sepsis, ARDS, and other fatal comorbidities.
Treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and combination in patients hospitalized with COVID-19;The United States is in an acceleration phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently there is no known effective therapy or vaccine for treatment of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting urgency around identifying effective therapies.
COVID-19 in children: Could pertussis vaccine play the protective role?;While COVID-19 continues to spread across the globe, diligent efforts are made to understand its attributes and dynamics to help develop treatment and prevention measures. The paradox pertaining to children being the least affected by severe illness poses exciting opportunities to investigate potential protective factors. In this paper, we propose that childhood vaccination against pertussis (whooping cough) might play a non-specific protective role against COVID-19 through heterologous adaptive responses in this young population. Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable infectious disease of the respiratory tract and it shares many similarities with COVID-19 including transmission and clinical features. Although pertussis is caused by a bacterium (
Free DNA, a reason for severe COVID-19 infection?;The fast-growing outbreak of 2019 novel coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) reached all continents except the Antarctica in merely three months. Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) has a bad clinical outcome, and some reports emphasized the role of cytokine storm and dysfunctions of multiple organs. However, the etiology of severe COVID-19 has been largely unknown. Similar as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is also thought derived from bat coronaviruses. However, it is not pathogenic for bat at all, because free DNA in cytoplasm or blood cannot bring up violent immune response in bat
Applicability of polyethylene glycol precipitation followed by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from municipal wastewater;The primary concentration and molecular process are critical to implement wastewater-based epidemiology for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the previously developed methods were optimized for nonenveloped viruses. Few studies evaluated if the methods are applicable to the efficient recovery of enveloped viruses from various types of raw sewage. This study aims (1) to compare the whole process recovery of 
A simple approach to optimum pool size for pooled SARS-CoV-2 testing;Systematic, large-scale testing of asymptomatic subjects is an important strategy in the management of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In order to increase the capacity of laboratory-based molecular SARS-CoV-2 testing, it has been suggested to combine several samples and jointly measure them in a sample pool. While saving cost and labour at first sight, pooling efficiency depends on the pool size and the presently experienced prevalence of positive samples. Here we address the question of the optimum pool size at a given prevalence. We demonstrate the relation between analytical effort and pool size and delineate the effects of the target prevalence on the optimum pool size. Finally, we derive a simple-to-use formula and table that allow laboratories performing sample pooling to assess the optimum pool size at the currently experienced target prevalence rate.

Are graphene and graphene-derived products capable of preventing COVID-19 infection?;The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This disease is a severe respiratory tract infection that spreading rapidly around the world. In this pandemic situation, the researchers' effort is to understand the targets of the virus, mechanism of their cause, and transmission from animal to human and vice-versa. Therefore, to support COVID-19 research and development, we have proposed approaches based on graphene and graphene-derived nanomaterials against COVID-19.
Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) with COVID-19: Insights from simultaneous familial Kawasaki Disease cases;Recently, an increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 patients with COVID-19 syndrome, which overlaps with Kawasaki Disease (KD), have been reported, supporting the suggestion that infection is one of the triggers of KD. We summarized the reports of simultaneous familial KD cases to better understand the etiopathogenesis of both KD and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) related to COVID-19. Here we discuss the etiology of these syndromes from the point of view of infection and genetic susceptibility.
The triggering of post-COVID-19 autoimmunity phenomena could be associated with both transient immunosuppression and an inappropriate form of immune reconstitution in susceptible individuals;With the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been different reports about the development of autoimmune diseases once the infection is controlled. After entering the respiratory epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2—the virus that causes the disease—triggers a severe inflammatory state in some patients known as “cytokine storm” and the development of thrombotic phenomena—both conditions being associated with high mortality. Patients additionally present severe lymphopenia and, in some cases, complement consumption and autoantibody development. There is a normalization of lymphocytes once the infection is controlled. After this, autoimmune conditions of unknown etiology may occur. A hypothesis for the development of post-COVID-19 autoimmunity is proposed based on the consequences of both a transient immunosuppression (both of innate and acquired immunity) in which self-tolerance is lost and an inappropriate form of immune reconstitution that amplifies the process.
Comprehensive evolution and molecular characteristics of a large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes reveal its epidemic trends;To further reveal the phylogenetic evolution and molecular characteristics of the whole genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on a large number of genomes and provide a basis for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Impact of Routine Infant BCG Vaccination on COVID-19;In Japan, the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was diagnosed on January 15, 2020 and subsequent infections rapidly increased. The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination program is the principal element of tuberculosis control in Japan. We investigated the impact of routine infant BCG vaccination on prevention of local COVID-19 spread.
One case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a patient co-infected by HIV with a low CD4;The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan, China, become an emergency of international concern when thousands of people were infected around the world. This study reports a case simultaneously infected by SARS-Cov-2 and HIV, which showed a longer disease course and slower generation of specific antibodies. This case highlights that a co-infection of SARS-Cov-2 and HIV may severely impair the immune system.
Host – virus – drug interactions as determinants of COVID-19’s phenotypes: A data-driven hypothesis;There is a growing body of evidence on the significance of interactions between comorbidities, their treatments and COVID-19 clinical phenotypes. The hypothesis explored herein is that pharmaceutical compounds currently in use are affecting COVID-19 susceptibility and phenotypes by overlapping transcriptional networks.
A call for strengthened evidence on targeted, non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 for the protection of vulnerable individuals in sub-Saharan Africa;Following the easing of lockdown measures in many sub-Saharan African countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases have been on the rise. As the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, may be difficult to stop in these settings, we propose that the existing COVID-19 prevention strategies aimed at reducing overall transmission are complemented with more targeted strategies to protect people at risk of severe COVID-19 disease. We suggest investigating the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of distributing COVID-19 prevention kits to households with persons at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease.
Role of testosterone in COVID-19 patients – A double-edged sword?;COVID-19 affects males twice as frequently as females with significantly increased severity and mortality. Current data suggest a direct correlation between the lower level of serum testosterone, inflammatory cytokines, disease severity, and poor clinical outcomes among male patients with COVID-19. The gradual decline in total and free testosterone levels has a direct correlation with serious pulmonary complications requiring advanced care (ICU, ventilators, ECMO, etc.). SARS-CoV-2 utilizes Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme II (ACE2) for entry in the host cell, and Transmembrane Protease, Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to prime spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Testosterone induces ACE-2 expression, a critical pulmonary protective enzyme. Low testosterone levels in males have a direct correlation with the high probability of ICU admission and the worse disease outcome (ARDS, duration of ICU stay, mortality). On the contrary, however, high testosterone levels can lead to thrombosis which is also one of the fatal manifestations in COVID-19 patients. A critical evaluation of the serum testosterone and its relevance to COVID-19 is warranted to re-evaluate strategies to effectively triage, prioritize, and manage high-risk patients for ICU admission, survival outcomes, targeted solutions, and operational algorithms.
Why is SARS-CoV-2 infection more severe in obese men? The gut lymphatics – Lung axis hypothesis;Consistent observations report increased severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in overweight men with cardiovascular factors. As the visceral fat possesses an intense immune activity, is involved in metabolic syndrome and is at the crossroad between the intestines, the systemic circulation and the lung, we hypothesized that it plays a major role in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV2 presents the ability to infect epithelial cells of the respiratory tract as well as the intestinal tract. Several factors may increase intestinal permeability including direct enterocyte damage by SARS-CoV2, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and epithelial ischemia secondary to SARS-CoV2- associated endothelial dysfunction. This increase permeability further leads to translocation of microbial components such as MAMPs (microbial-associated molecular pattern), triggering an inflammatory immune response by TLR-expressing cells of the mesentery fat (mostly macrophages and adipocytes). The pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the mesentery fat mediates systemic inflammation and aggravate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) through the mesenteric lymph drainage.
CT scan does not make a diagnosis of Covid-19: A cautionary case report;Here, we report the clinical case of a 12-year-old girl presenting with flu-like symptoms, cough, anosmia, ageusia, breathing difficulties, and patchy ground glass opacities on TDM chest scan who turned out to be Coronavirus 229E-infected. This case draws attention to the risk of false COVID-19 diagnosis when over-relying on CT scan imaging.

An outbreak of severe Kawasaki-like disease at the Italian epicentre of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic: an observational cohort study;The Bergamo province, which is extensively affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, is a natural observatory of virus manifestations in the general population. In the past month we recorded an outbreak of Kawasaki disease
Neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 and possible pathogenic mechanisms: Insights from other coronaviruses;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a global public health threat. Though the fear, anxiety, and stress related to COVID-19 have been studied in depth, the direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the central nervous system (CNS) remain elusive. Research related to the earlier coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks (like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS) shows the neurotropic nature of CoV and the plethora of neuropsychiatric effects that it can cause. Though the current health priorities in managing COVID-19 remain restricted to containment and targeting pulmonary symptoms, the potential acute and long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae of the infection can increase morbidity and worsen the quality of life. Emerging evidence shows neural spread of the novel coronavirus. Delirium, encephalopathy, olfactory disturbances, acute behavioral changes, headache and cerebrovascular accidents are its common neuropsychiatric complications. These are directly related to increase in peripheral immunological markers, severity of infection and case fatality rate. This narrative review synthesizes available evidence related to the neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19. Also, as SARS-CoV-2 shares structural and functional similarities with its earlier congeners, this article proposes possible long-term neuropsychological sequelae and pathogenic mechanisms for the same, based on research in the other coronavirus outbreaks.
Safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBIBP-CorV: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 trial;The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic warrants accelerated efforts to test vaccine candidates. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine candidate, BBIBP-CorV, in humans.
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and influenza pandemics;The objective of this Personal View is to compare transmissibility, hospitalisation, and mortality rates for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with those of other epidemic coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and pandemic influenza viruses. The basic reproductive rate (
A potential therapeutic combination for treatment of COVID-19: Synergistic effect of DPP4 and RAAS suppression;COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is an abbreviated name for coronavirus disease 2019. COVID-19 became a global pandemic in early 2020. It predominantly affects not only the upper and lower respiratory tract, but also multiple organs, including the kidney, heart, and brain. The mortality of COVID-19 patients is high in men and in elderly patients with age-related diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. The angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), a component in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), plays as cell surface receptors for SARS-CoV-2. A recent study proved that coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 also uses dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4, also known as adenosine deaminase complexing protein 2, CD26) as a co-receptor when entering cells. In addition, DPP4 is also implicated in the regulation of the immune response. Thus, the combination of DPP4 inhibition and suppression of ACE-2/RAAS may be a novel therapeutic strategy for combating this pandemic.
Interventions to mitigate early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore: a modelling study;Since the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019, 68 imported cases and 175 locally acquired infections have been reported in Singapore. We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful.
Case report study of the first five COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir in France;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak worldwide. Data on treatment are scare and parallels have been made between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral with efficient in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Evidence of clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir is controversial. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical outcomes and virological monitoring of the first five COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France, for severe pneumonia related to SARS-CoV-2 and treated with remdesivir. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in blood plasma and the lower and upper respiratory tract. Among the five patients treated, two needed mechanical ventilation and one needed high-flow cannula oxygen. A significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract was observed in most cases, but two patients died with active SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lower respiratory tract. Plasma samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in only one patient. Remdesivir was interrupted before the initialy planned duration in four patients, two because of alanine aminotransferase elevations (3 to 5 normal range) and two because of renal failure requiring renal replacement. This case series of five COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit treatment for respiratory distress and treated with remdesivir, highlights the complexity of remdesivir use in such critically ill patients.
Oral manifestations in a patient with a history of asymptomatic COVID-19: Case report;The pandemic situation has led to public health measures that have forced patients with and without the SARS-CoV-2 virus to remain isolated and take steps to prevent the spread. Many of these patients have been unable to attend the control of medical-dental services, which in many cases complicates their situation. This study reports on the oral manifestations of an asymptomatic COVID-19 patient treated interdisciplinary by teleconsultation due to the sudden appearance of lesions in the oral mucosa. Lesions are diagnosed, therapeutic measures are taken, and improvement is shown. This case shows that the problems that arise in the oral mucosa in patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection can be monitored through interdisciplinary teleconsultation during the pandemic with the support of information technology currently available worldwide. It also decreases the risk of transmission of SARS-Cov-2 between patients and health professionals.
Clinical immunity in discharged medical patients with COVID-19;Most studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection show that people who have recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies to the virus. No study has evaluated whether the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confers immunity to the infection relapse but however, to date, no human reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 have been confirmed.
Optimal temperature zone for the dispersal of COVID-19;It is essential to know the environmental parameters within which the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can survive to understand its global dispersal pattern. We found that 60.0% of the confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in places where the air temperature ranged from 5 °C to 15 °C, with a peak in cases at 11.54 °C. Moreover, approximately 73.8% of the confirmed cases were concentrated in regions with absolute humidity of 3 g/m
Pulmonary surfactant itself must be a strong defender against SARS-CoV-2;Pulmonary surfactant is considered to be one of the soaps. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the other enveloped viruses become very weak against surfactant. The SARS virus binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor and causes pneumonia. In the lung, the ACE2 receptor sits on the top of lung cells known as alveolar epithelial type II (AE2) cells. These cells play an important role in producing surfactant. Pulmonary surfactant is believed to regulate the alveolar surface tension in mammalian lungs. To our knowledge, AE2 cells are believed to act as immunoregulatory cells
A dramatic rise in serum ACE2 activity in a critically ill COVID-19 patient;Endothelial cells express surface angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 that promotes the infection of endothelial cells showing activation and damage. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from COVID-19 subjects showed a critical imbalance in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with upregulated expression of ACE2. Recently, intravenous recombinant ACE2 was reported as an effective therapy in severe COVID-19 by blocking the viral entry to target cells. Here we present a case of a critically ill COVID-19 patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome where circulating ACE2 was first measured to monitor disease prognosis. ACE2 activity increased about 40-fold over the normal range and showed a distinct time course compared to 2-3-fold higher levels of endothelium biomarkers. Although the level of soluble E-selectin followed the clinical status of our patient similarly to ferritin and IL-6 levels, the dramatic rise in serum ACE2 activity may act as an endogenous nonspecific protective mechanism against SARS-CoV-2 infection that preceded the recovery of our patient.
Urgent need for evaluating agonists of angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis for treating patients with COVID-19;ACE2 is a receptor of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells, and its upregulation has been implicated in increasing susceptibility of individuals to this infection. The clinical picture of COVID-19 suggests a role of ACE2 blockade, rather than its overexpression, in causing the pathogenesis. ACE2 blockade results in increased angiotensin II activity with simultaneous hampering of functions of angiotensin-(1-7)/MasR axis. Acute respiratory distress due to interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, cardiomyopathy and shock reported in COVID-19 patients can be explained by imbalanced angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) activities. Failure of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers to control the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections indicates the importance of simultaneous induction of angiotensin-(1-7)/MasR axis for correcting pathological conditions in COVID-19 through its anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and cardioprotective roles. MasR agonists have also shown organ protective effects in a number of animal studies. Unfortunately, these agonists have not been tested in clinical studies. Their evaluation in seriously ill COVID-19 patients is urgently warranted to reduce mortality due to infection.
Successful recovery of severe COVID-19 with cytokine storm treating with extracorporeal blood purification;COVID-19 associated cytokine storm could rapidly induce ARDS, and the patients would require mechanical ventilation. However, the prognosis was not that optimistic. The outcome might be changed if the timely intervention of EBP was performed. We present a case of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection who recovered from a cytokine storm.
Cross-immunity between respiratory coronaviruses may limit COVID-19 fatalities;Of the seven coronaviruses associated with disease in humans, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cause considerable mortality but also share significant sequence homology, and potentially antigenic epitopes capable of inducing an immune response. The degree of similarity is such that perhaps prior exposure to one virus could confer partial immunity to another. Indeed, data suggests a considerable amount of cross-reactivity and recognition by the hosts immune response between different coronavirus infections. While the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak rapidly overwhelmed medical facilities of particularly Europe and North America, accounting for 78% of global deaths, only 8% of deaths have occurred in Asia where the outbreak originated. Interestingly, Asia and the Middle East have previously experienced multiple rounds of coronavirus infections, perhaps suggesting buildup of acquired immunity to the causative SARS-CoV-2 that underlies COVID-19. This article hypothesizes that a causative factor underlying such low morbidity in these regions is perhaps (at least in part) due to acquired immunity from multiple rounds of coronavirus infections and discusses the mechanisms and recent evidence to support such assertions. Further investigations of such phenomenon would allow us to examine strategies to confer protective immunity, perhaps aiding vaccine development.
Could autism spectrum disorders be a risk factor for COVID-19?;The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemia is infecting millions of people and some studies relate conditions that might increase the risk of developing a fatal course for the disease, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and obesity. In COVID-19 physiopathology, one of the main inflammation mechanisms is the “cytokine storm”, causing a pro-inflammatory state, related to cardiac and pulmonary damage. There is also a less effective role of lymphocyte B and T in the humoral immunity due to the reduction of their proliferative response. The physiopathology of ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) involves several modifications at the genetic and at the immune level, such as the increase of inflammatory cytokines and abnormal immune response in several levels. We hypothesize that ASD could be a risk-factor as the other conditions are.
Is periodontal disease a risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness?;Periodontal disease (PD) comprises a group of diseases involving inflammatory aspects of the host and dysbiotic events that affect periodontal tissues and could have systemic implications. Diverse factors and comorbidities have been closely associated with PD such as diabetes, obesity, aging, hypertension, and so on
Observations of the global epidemiology of COVID-19 from the prepandemic period using web-based surveillance: a cross-sectional analysis;Background
Is copper beneficial for COVID-19 patients?;Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for both pathogens and the hosts during viral infection. Cu is involved in the functions of critical immune cells such as T helper cells, B cells, neutrophils natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages. These blood cells are involved in the killing of infectious microbes, in cell-mediated immunity and the production of specific antibodies against the pathogens. Cu-deficient humans show an exceptional susceptibility to infections due to the decreased number and function of these blood cells. Besides, Cu can kill several infectious viruses such as bronchitis virus, poliovirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1), other enveloped or nonenveloped, single- or double-stranded DNA and RNA viruses. Moreover, Cu has the potent capacity of contact killing of several viruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2. Since the current outbreak of the COVID-19 continues to develop, and there is no vaccine or drugs are currently available, the critical option is now to make the immune system competent to fight against the SARS‐CoV‐2. Based on available data, we hypothesize that enrichment of plasma copper levels will boost both the innate and adaptive immunity in people. Moreover, owing to its potent antiviral activities, Cu may also act as a preventive and therapeutic regime against COVID-19.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO): does it have a role in the treatment of severe COVID-19?;The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged since December 2019 in Wuhan city, and has quickly spread throughout China and other countries. To date, no specific treatment has been proven to be effective for SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to World Health Organization (WHO), management of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has mainly focused on infection prevention, case detection and monitoring, and supportive care. Given to the previous experience, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been proven to be an effective therapy in the treatment of respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). On the basis of similar principle, ECMO may be also an effective therapy in the treatment of severe COVID-19. In this study, we described and discussed the clinical outcomes of ECMO for ARDS patients, ECMO use for severe COVID-19 in China, the indications of ECMO use, and some important issues associated with ECMO.
Role of inositol to improve surfactant functions and reduce IL-6 levels: A potential adjuvant strategy for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia?;To date, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection is increasing worldwide and represents a primary healthcare emergency. Although the infection can be asymptomatic, several cases develop severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterized by high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, primarily interleukin (IL)-6. Based on available data, the severity of ARDS and serum levels of IL-6 are key determinants for the prognosis.
Is macrophages heterogeneity important in determining COVID-19 lethality?;COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 has led to the death of thousands of adults worldwide. It is now clear that the hyper-inflammatory response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 plays a major role in disease severity and lethality of the infection. Macrophages are innate immune cells that sense and respond to infections by producing a plethora of inflammatory molecules and by interacting with other inflammatory cells. Therefore, macrophages may be diriment on eliminating pathogens and promoting organ repair. However, macrophages can be a major player of the so called 
A potential role for cyclophosphamide in the mitigation of acute respiratory distress syndrome among patients with SARS-CoV-2;While humanity struggles to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, it is imperative that effective and affordable therapeutic strategies be evolved. Since a majority of the SARS-CoV-2 deaths are due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a strategy to mitigate the same could save countless lives. Since SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS has a strong immunological component, many investigators are utilizing monoclonal antibodies against IL-6, TNF-alpha and CCR5. However, targeting a single cytokine with an expensive monoclonal antibody could be a less pragmatic approach. We propose the use of cyclophosphamide as an immunomodulator, given its proven role in various settings including autoimmune diseases, and in the post-haploidentical stem cell transplant. Cyclophosphamide could deplete cytotoxic and effector T cell populations while relatively sparing the regulatory T cells (Tregs). Cyclophosphamide could tip the balance away from the overtly pro-inflammatory and could be a less expensive and effective alternative to the currently investigated monoclonal antibodies.
Association of inflammatory markers with the severity of COVID-19: A meta-analysis;Studies reported associations of inflammatory markers with the severity of COVID-19, but conclusions were inconsistent. We aimed to provide an overview of the association of inflammatory markers with the severity of COVID-19.
Integrated control of COVID-19 in resource-poor countries;Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face many challenges in controlling COVID-19. Healthcare resources are limited and so are ICU beds. RT-PCR testing is conducted on a limited scale and treatment options are few. There is no vaccine. Therefore, what low-cost solutions remain for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2? How should these essential health services be delivered in order to reach the most vulnerable in our societies? In this editorial we discuss several important strategies for controlling COVID-19 including: vaccination, molecular and serological diagnostics, hygiene and WaSH interventions, and low-cost therapeutics. We also discuss the delivery of such services in order to reach the most in need. The proposed integrated control strategy requires immediate action and political will in order to reduce the widening health inequalities caused by the pandemic.
Alpha-lipoic acid may protect patients with diabetes against COVID-19 infection;COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly worldwide, and drug selection can affect the morbidity and mortality of the disease positively or negatively. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a potent antioxidant and reduces oxidative stress and inhibits activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB). ALA reduces ADAM17 activity and ACE2 upregulation. ALA is known to have antiviral effects against some viruses. ALA may show antiviral effect by reducing NF-kB activation and alleviating redox reactions. ALA increases the intracellular glutathione strengthens the human host defense. ALA activates ATP dependent K
COVID-19 concomitant with infective endocarditis: A case report and review of management;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic and public health crisis across the world. With its high infectivity and rapid spread, the severity of the disease is escalating in certain populations, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. In developing countries, infective endocarditis remains a problem in patients with rheumatic heart disease. We report the case of a patient with a diagnosis of infective endocarditis concomitant with COVID-19, including the diagnosis, management, and main outcomes.
Evidence from two cases of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2: Are 14 days of isolation sufficient?;Among 78 laboratory-confirmed cases, we found two asymptomatic infections. One patient was discharged within 14 days after treatment. Another patient was discharged 25 days after treatment, and his RT-PCR test was still positive on the 15th day. We found that there may be virus carriers in the asymptomatic population with an epidemiological contact history. After 14 days of isolation, those with asymptomatic infection may still carry the virus, which means a risk of transmission, presenting a new challenge for the management of home isolation.
Potential of electric stimulation for the management of COVID-19;The COVID-19 pandemic is the most devastating health emergency that humans have seen over the past century. The war against the disease has been handicapped by unavailability of effective therapeutic options. Till date, there is no clinically approved vaccine or drug for the treatment of COVID-19, and the ongoing search to find a novel therapy is progressing at pandemic pace. Herein, we propose a novel hypothesis based on sound research evidence that electric stimulation can be a potential adjuvant to the currently used symptomatic therapies and antiviral drugs. Based on preclinical evidence, we propose that electric stimulation can improve respiratory functions, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 growth, reduce pain, boost immunity and improve the penetration of antiviral drugs. We envisage that our hypothesis, if used clinically as an adjuvant, may significantly improve the therapeutic outcomes of the current treatment regimen being used around the globe for the management of COVID-19.
Susceptibility of the obese population to COVID-19;Obesity has been reported to be a risk factor for COVID-19 severity.
Can hyperbaric oxygen safely serve as an anti-inflammatory treatment for COVID-19?;SARS-CoV-2 affects part of the innate immune response and activates an inflammatory cascade stimulating the release of cytokines and chemokines, particularly within the lung. Indeed, the inflammatory response during COVID-19 is likely the cause for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients with mild symptoms also show significant changes on pulmonary CT-scan suggestive of severe inflammatory involvement.
Remdesivir in adults with severe COVID-19: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial;No specific antiviral drug has been proven effective for treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models.
Hypothesis for the management and treatment of the COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome and lung injury using mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a member of the coronaviridae that causes respiratory disorders. After infection, large amounts of inflammatory cytokines are secreted, known as the cytokine storm. These cytokines can cause pulmonary damage induced by inflammation resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death.
SARS – CoV-2: Reasons of epidemiology of severe ill disease cases and therapeutic approach using trivalent vaccine (tetanus, diphtheria and Bordetella pertussis);The novel coronavirus Covid-19 follows transmission route and clinical presentation of all community-acquired coronaviruses. Instead, the rate of transmission is significative higher, with a faster spread of the virus responsible of the worldwide outbreak and a significative higher mortality rate due to the development of a severe lung injury. Most noteworthy is the distribution of death rate among age groups. Children and younger people are almost protected from severe clinical presentation.
Oral mucosal lesions in a COVID-19 patient: New signs or secondary manifestations?;Some oral manifestations have been observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there is still a question about whether these lesions are due to coronavirus infection or secondary manifestations resulting from the patient's systemic condition. Thus, this article aims to report an additional case of an oral condition in a patient diagnosed with COVID-19. Our patient, a sixty-seven-year-old Caucasian man, tested positive to coronavirus and presented oral manifestations such as recurrent herpes simplex, candidiasis, and geographic tongue. We support the argument that some oral conditions could be secondary to the deterioration of systemic health or due to treatments for COVID-19. The present case report highlights the importance of including dentists in the intensive care unit multi-professional team to improve oral health in critical patients, not only COVID-19 patients, but also, to contribute to evidence-based and decision-making in managing infectious diseases.
Using a diagnostic model based on routine laboratory tests to distinguish patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 from those infected with influenza virus;The differential diagnosis between novel coronavirus pneumonia patients (NCPP) and influenza patients (IP) remains a challenge in clinical practice.
Effect of meteorological parameters on spread of COVID-19 in India and air quality during lockdown;The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and has created a medical emergency worldwide. In India, it is already reported more than 855 thousand cases and more than 22 thousands deaths due to COVID-19 till July 12, 2020. The role of temperature, humidity, and absolute humidity in the transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been well established. In contrast, for the previous many viral infections like influenza, it is well established. Therefore the study to investigate the meteorological condition for incidence and spread of COVID-19 infection and to provide a scientific basis for prevention and control measures against the new disease is required for India. In this work, we analyze daily averaged meteorological data for the last three years (2017–2019) for March, April and May months and the same for the year 2020 for March 1 to May 31. We found a positive association between daily COVID-19 cases and temperature and a mixed association with relative and absolute humidity over India. We have investigated the association of aerosols (AOD) and other pollutions (NO
COVID-19 in health-care workers in three hospitals in the south of the Netherlands: a cross-sectional study;10 days after the first reported case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the Netherlands (on Feb 27, 2020), 55 (4%) of 1497 health-care workers in nine hospitals located in the south of the Netherlands had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We aimed to gain insight in possible sources of infection in health-care workers.
HIV care in times of the COVID-19 crisis — Where are we now in Central and Eastern Europe?;The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has hit the European region disproportionately. Many HIV clinics share staff and logistics with infectious disease facilities, which are now on the frontline in tackling COVID-19. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of the current pandemic situation on HIV care and continuity of antiretroviral treatment (ART) supplies in CEE countries.
Innate immunity in COVID-19 patients mediated by NKG2A receptors, and potential treatment using Monalizumab, Cholroquine, and antiviral agents;Following the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), studies suggest that the resultant disease (COVID-19) is more severe in individuals with a weakened immune system. Cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells are required to generate an effective immune response against viruses, functional exhaustion of which enables disease progression. Patients with severe COVID-19 present significantly lower lymphocyte, and higher neutrophil, counts in blood. Specifically, CD8
Possible environmental effects on the spread of COVID-19 in China;At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, designated as SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China and was identified as the causal pathogen of COVID-19. The epidemic scale of COVID-19 has increased dramatically, with confirmed cases increasing across China and globally. Understanding the potential affecting factors involved in COVID-19 transmission will be of great significance in containing the spread of the epidemic. Environmental and meteorological factors might impact the occurrence of COVID-19, as these have been linked to various diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), whose causative pathogens belong to the same virus family as SARS-CoV-2. We collected daily data of COVID-19 confirmed cases, air quality and meteorological variables of 33 locations in China for the outbreak period of 29 January 2020 to 15 February 2020. The association between air quality index (AQI) and confirmed cases was estimated through a Poisson regression model, and the effects of temperature and humidity on the AQI-confirmed cases association were analyzed. The results show that the effect of AQI on confirmed cases associated with an increase in each unit of AQI was statistically significant in several cities. The lag effect of AQI on the confirmed cases was statistically significant on lag day 1 (relative risk (RR) = 1.0009, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0004, 1.0013), day 2 (RR = 1.0007, 95% CI: 1.0003, 1.0012) and day 3 (RR = 1.0008, 95% CI: 1.0003, 1.0012). The AQI effect on the confirmed cases might be stronger in the temperature range of 10 °C ≤ 
Autoimmunity to ACE2 as a possible cause of tissue inflammation in Covid-19;The delayed lung damage after SARS-CoV-2 infection may be caused by an autoimmune response to ACE2 induced by forced presentation of the ACE2 protein in a complex with CoV Spike in Fc Receptor positive Antigen Presenting Cells in the lung. The likelihood that this hypothesis is valid is 
Clinical management and mortality among COVID-19 cases in sub-Saharan Africa: A retrospective study from Burkina Faso and simulated case analysis;Absolute numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported to date in the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region have been significantly lower than those across the Americas, Asia and Europe. As a result, there has been limited information about the demographic and clinical characteristics of deceased cases in the region, as well as the impacts of different case management strategies.
Nebulized Lidocaine in COVID-19, An Hypothesis;Coronavirus Diseases-2019 (COVID-19) has caused a large global outbreak and has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). It has been proposed that COVID-19-related hyperinflammation and dysregulated immune response might play a critical role in developing a cytokine storm which usually progresses to a life-threatening acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome in infected individuals. Lidocaine, a local analgesic and anti-arrhythmic, is known for its anti-inflammatory actions and has been used to reduce cough and improve respiratory symptoms in severe asthmatic patients. It has a demonstrated safety profile. It is proposed that nebulized lidocaine might be beneficial in reducing cytokines, protecting patients’ lungs and improving outcomes in COVID-19 patients when administered via inhalation as an adjunctive treatment for severe respiratory symptoms in patients fighting the novel Coronavirus. Additional investigation is warranted.
Assessing the effects of metropolitan-wide quarantine on the spread of COVID-19 in public space and households;Hubei province in China has completed cycle of quarantine-resumption in 23rd Janauary and 8th April 2020, providing a unique opportunity as for now to assess its intervention impact and the pattern of SARS-COV-2 transmission during the quarantine period. In this study, we evaluate the impact of the metropolitan-wide quarantine on the trend and transmission route of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei, China. The intervention reduces more than 70% of new infections in both households and the public space, as well as the deaths caused by COVID-19 pneumonia. Household transmission is the dominant route of disease spread regardless of quarantine. This will provide important evidence and scientific insights to other worldwide countries that are currently under quarantine.
Does gender influence clinical expression and disease outcomes in COVID-19? A systematic review and meta-analysis;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) was characterized at the end of 2019, and soon spread around the world, generating a pandemic. It has been suggested that men are more severely affected by the viral disease (COVID-19) than women.
Delivery of infection from asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 in a familial cluster;With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 around the world, it has become a worldwide health concern. One previous study reported a family cluster with an asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19. Here, we report another series of cases and further demonstrate the repeatability of the transmission of COVID-19 by pre-symptomatic carriers.
Timing of national lockdown and mortality in COVID-19: The Italian experience;To evaluate if the pandemic mitigation effects of lockdown in Italy have been influenced by the level of penetration of COVID-19 in Italian Regions at the onset of containment (March 9, 2020).
Risk factors of critical & mortal COVID-19 cases: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis;An epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December 2019 and triggered a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). We aimed to find risk factors for the progression of COVID-19 to help reducing the risk of critical illness and death for clinical help.
Rethinking and optimising plastic waste management under COVID-19 pandemic: Policy solutions based on redesign and reduction of single-use plastics and personal protective equipment;Plastics have been on top of the political agenda in Europe and across the world to reduce plastic leakage and pollution. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted plastic reduction policies at the regional and national levels and induced significant changes in plastic waste management with potential for negative impacts in the environment and human health. This paper provides an overview of plastic policies and discusses the readjustments of these policies during the COVID-19 pandemic along with their potential environmental implications.
COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia: Actions taken by the Malaysian government;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel pneumonia disease originating in Wuhan, was confirmed by the World Health Organization on January 12, 2020 before becoming an outbreak in all countries.
Is anosmia the price to pay in an immune-induced scorched-earth policy against COVID-19?;Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), loss of smell has increasingly been reported as a frequent clinical sign. Understanding the underlying mechanism and the prognostic value of this symptom will help better manage patients. SARS-CoV-2, as SARS-CoV-1, may likely spread to the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory nerve, a known gateway for respiratory neurotropic viruses. We hypothesise that sudden loss of smell due to COVID-19 is the consequence of a protective host defence mechanism involving apoptosis of olfactory receptor neurons. Sacrificing smelling over neuroprotection is a logical strategy, even more so as olfaction is the only sense with the ability to regenerate in adults. Induced apoptosis of olfactory neurons has been shown in mice, successfully preventing neuroinvasion. On the other hand, adult olfactory neurogenesis has been shown to be regulated in part by the immune system, allowing to restore olfactory function. Understanding anosmia as part of a defence mechanism would support the concept of sudden anosmia as being a positive prognostic factor in the short term. Also, it may orient research to investigate the risk of future neurodegenerative disease linked to persisting coronavirus in neurons.
Hypokalemia as a sensitive biomarker of disease severity and the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation requirement in COVID-19 pneumonia: A case series of 306 Mediterranean patients;Serum levels of potassium (K
Duration of viral shedding in asymptomatic or mild cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from a cruise ship: A single-hospital experience in Tokyo, Japan;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the cause of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first reported in Wuhan, China, and now has spread across the world as a global pandemic. The propagation from asymptomatic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive individuals represents a complicating factor in the efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the course of PCR assays and the duration of viral shedding in 23 asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients from the cruise ship who were admitted to our hospital. Among these 23 cases, the median duration of viral shedding was 19 days (range, 6–37 days) from initial viral detection. Eight cases (35%) had another positive PCR result after testing negative once. Although the duration of viral shedding was approximately three weeks, the infectivity and transmissibility period from asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 cases is unclear. Further studies are needed to determine how long such asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 cases have infectivity.
Pneumonia in medical professionals during COVID-19 outbreak in cardiovascular hospital;The pandemic of coronavirus associated disease (COVID-19) placed the health care workers at high risk. We investigated clinical and treatment characteristics of infected medical professionals in a cardiovascular hospital.
Epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in 391 cases and 1286 of their close contacts in Shenzhen, China: a retrospective cohort study;Rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen, China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures.
A hypothesis on the role of the human immune system in covid-19;The COVID-19 pandemic has not spared any continent. The disease has affected more than 7,500,000 individuals globally and killed approximately 450,000 individuals. The disease is caused by a very small virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus with a spike-like structure on its envelope that can interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor after cleavage. ACE2 receptors are present in the human lungs and other organs. SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus that belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus
Heat warning and public and workers' health at the time of COVID-19 pandemic;The humanity is currently facing the COVID-19 pandemic challenge, the largest global health emergency after the Second World War. During summer months, many countries in the northern hemisphere will also have to counteract an imminent seasonal phenomenon, the management of extreme heat events. The novelty this year concerns that the world population will have to deal with a new situation that foresees the application of specific measures, including adjunctive personal protective equipment (i.e. facemasks and gloves), in order to reduce the potential transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These measures should help to decrease the risk of the infection transmission but will also represent an aggravating factor to counteract the heat effects on the population health both at occupational and environmental level. The use of a specific heat health warning system with personalized information based on individual, behavioural and environmental characteristics represents a necessary strategy to help a fast adaptation of the population at a time where the priority is to live avoiding SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Insight into 2019 novel coronavirus — An updated interim review and lessons from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV;The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has become a global threat. Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions.
Do superspreaders generate new superspreaders? A hypothesis to explain the propagation pattern of COVID-19;The current global propagation of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, with slow transmission continuing in many countries and exponential propagation in others, where the time that it took for the explosive spread to begin varied greatly. It is proposed that this could be explained by cascading superspreading events, in which new infections caused by a superspreader are more likely to be highly infectious. The mechanism suggested for this is related to viral loads. Exposure to high viral loads may result in high-intensity infection, which exposes new cases to high viral loads. This notion is supported by experimental veterinary research.
Social consequences of COVID-19 in a low resource setting in Sierra Leone, West Africa;Economical and psychological consequences of the lockdown in low-resource setting in rural Africa are unknown. We drafted a survey in order to address the social impact of COVID-19 lockdown on a rural village in Sierra Leone. The survey developed by the study group and translated in the local language, distributed to the householders of the village on April 13th and responses collected on April 14th, when Sierra Leone was on day 11 of lockdown. The questions aimed to assess in the community the following items: age group, main activities before lockdown, change in income and ability to feed the family during lockdown, anxiety during lockdown. 78 householders (100% of Bureh Town) replied. All, expect one, declared a 51−80% (19.2%) to 81−100% (79.4%) reduction of weekly income compared with the pre-lockdown period, declaring difficulties in providing food for the family members (82%), and anxiety (60%). Our analyses showed that people lost their jobs and have difficulties in providing food for their families.
COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers in a national healthcare system: The Qatar experience;Our aim was to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) in a national healthcare system and to understand the risk factors for infection.
Platelets to surrogate lung inflammation in COVID-19 patients;The neoteric severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been jeopardizing the world with the symptoms of seasonal flu. The virus contagion predicted to have been originated from Wuhan, China has by far trapped 4,198,418 cases from 212 countries in the world with two international conveyances with 284,102 deaths as of 11 May 2020 (10:18 GMT). Researchers around the globe have indulged in deciphering viral mode in the body for devising a cure. Affirmations from autopsies and preliminary findings on SARS-CoV-2 hypothesized on viral pathogenesis within the host, for instance, source of inflammation in lungs and pneumonia. This hypothesis assigns the platelets as agents of infection after viral entry. Presently, curbing infection to stall the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the prima facie intervention employed, worldwide. However, public health authorities must monitor the state of affairs scrupulously, as the deeper our understanding of this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can deal with it. Knowing this idea might be far-fetched, yet this postulate would serve as the groundwork for the present situation.
Clinical Characteristics of Asymptomatic Patients with COVID-19: A Nationwide Cohort Study in South Korea;To delineate clinical characteristics of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients confirmed with COVID-19 in South Korea.
A minimal common outcome measure set for COVID-19 clinical research;Clinical research is necessary for an effective response to an emerging infectious disease outbreak. However, research efforts are often hastily organised and done using various research tools, with the result that pooling data across studies is challenging. In response to the needs of the rapidly evolving COVID-19 outbreak, the Clinical Characterisation and Management Working Group of the WHO Research and Development Blueprint programme, the International Forum for Acute Care Trialists, and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium have developed a minimum set of common outcome measures for studies of COVID-19. This set includes three elements: a measure of viral burden (quantitative PCR or cycle threshold), a measure of patient survival (mortality at hospital discharge or at 60 days), and a measure of patient progression through the health-care system by use of the WHO Clinical Progression Scale, which reflects patient trajectory and resource use over the course of clinical illness. We urge investigators to include these key data elements in ongoing and future studies to expedite the pooling of data during this immediate threat, and to hone a tool for future needs.
Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study;Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.
COVID-19 and anosmia in Tehran, Iran;Patients with acute olfactory disorders typically present to the otolaryngologist with both acute hyposmia and less often with anosmia. With the onset of COVID-19 we have noticed an increase in the number of patients who have presented with new onset of complete smell loss to the senior author’s practice in Tehran, Iran. This anosmia and the frequency with which patients present is highly unusual. Coronaviruses have been known to cause common cold symptoms. COVID-19 infections have been described as causing more severe respiratory infections and the symptoms reported by authors from Wuhan, China have not specifically included anosmia. We describe patients who have presented during a two-week period of the COVID-19 pandemic with complete loss of sense of smell. Most had either no symptoms or mild respiratory symptoms. Many had a normal otolaryngologic exam. A relationship between COVID-19 and anosmia should be considered during the pandemic. We hypothesize that the mechanism of injury is similar to that of other coronavirus infections that cause central and peripheral neurologic deficits.
Household secondary attack rate of COVID-19 and associated determinants in Guangzhou, China: a retrospective cohort study;As of June 8, 2020, the global reported number of COVID-19 cases had reached more than 7 million with over 400 000 deaths. The household transmissibility of the causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains unclear. We aimed to estimate the secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 among household and non-household close contacts in Guangzhou, China, using a statistical transmission model.
COVID-19 as a viral functional ACE2 deficiency disorder with ACE2 related multi-organ disease;SARS-CoV-2, the agent of COVID-19, shares a lineage with SARS-CoV-1, and a common fatal pulmonary profile but with striking differences in presentation, clinical course, and response to treatment. In contrast to SARS-CoV-1 (SARS), COVID-19 has presented as an often bi-phasic, multi-organ pathology, with a proclivity for severe disease in the elderly and those with hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Whilst death is usually related to respiratory collapse, autopsy reveals multi-organ pathology. Chronic pulmonary disease is underrepresented in the group with severe COVID-19. A commonality of aberrant renin angiotensin system (RAS) is suggested in the at-risk group. The identification of angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor allowing viral entry to cells precipitated our interest in the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathogenesis.
COVID-19-related complications and decompression illness share main features.;A study by Saraiva et al. (2011) demonstrated the presence of Angiotensin II receptors on the erythrocyte membrane. This little-known information should be deemed as crucial as the SARS-CoV-2 relationships with oxygen saturation and the Renine Angiotensin System but it currently remains unexploited.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of published research data on COVID-19 infection fatality rates;An important unknown during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been the infection fatality rate (IFR). This differs from the case fatality rate (CFR) as an estimate of the number of deaths and as a proportion of the total number of cases, including those who are mild and asymptomatic. While the CFR is extremely valuable for experts, IFR is increasingly being called for by policy makers and the lay public as an estimate of the overall mortality from COVID-19.
Early characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak predict the subsequent epidemic scope;The mostly-resolved first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in China provided a unique opportunity to investigate how the initial characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak predict its subsequent magnitude.
Implications for air quality management of changes in air quality during lockdown in Auckland (New Zealand) in response to the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 epidemic;The current changes in vehicle movement due to ‘lockdown’ conditions (imposed in cities worldwide in response to the COVID-19 epidemic) provide opportunities to quantify the local impact of ‘controlled interventions’ on air quality and establish baseline pollution concentrations in cities. Here, we present a case study from Auckland, New Zealand, an isolated Southern Hemisphere city, which is largely unaffected by long-range pollution transport or industrial sources of air pollution. In this city, traffic flows reduced by 60–80% as a result of a government-led initiative to contain the virus by limiting all transport to only essential services. In this paper, ambient pollutant concentrations of NO
Potential mechanisms of nafamostat therapy for severe COVID-19 pneumonia with disseminated intravascular coagulation;Nafamostat, a serine proteinase inhibitor with various actions including antithrombin, antiplasmin, and antitrypsin effects, has been used in clinical practice to treat disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and pancreatitis. In this case report, the clinical course of a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia whose severe hypoxemia, probably caused by DIC and pulmonary embolism, showed remarkable improvement with combination heparin and nafamostat therapy, is described. In addition, beneficial mechanisms of nafamostat against COVID-19 and the necessity of attention to hyperkalemia as an adverse effect are discussed.
A hypothesis for examining dihydroxyacetone, the active component in sunless tanning products, as a topical prophylactic against SARS-COV-2 transmission;This hypothesis raises the interesting prospect that dihydroxyacetone (DHA), the key ingredient in self-tanning creams, when applied daily to the face and hands may have prophylactic action against SARS-COV-2 transmission and infection. The scientific and mechanistic basis for this hypothesis is elaborated based on our understanding of the chemical reactivity of DHA with proteins to afford advanced glycation products. This piece ends with a proposal for doing key experiments that can be run to test this hypothesis. As more than 30 million people have been infected with this disease world-wide, a safe method for stopping spread is worthy of consideration. Publication of this hypothesis would enable the scientific community at large to test this in a clinically meaningful setting to address the potential for DHA-based prophylaxis. Given the calamity of this crisis, it is anticipated that the publication of this hypothesis, which is supported by key studies on protein and nucleoside glycation, can be disseminated to as many researchers as possible.
Geospatial analysis of COVID-19 lockdown effects on air quality in the South and Southeast Asian region;The COVID-19 pandemic, induced by the novel Coronavirus worldwide outbreak, is causing countries to introduce different types of lockdown measures to curb the contagion. The implementation of strict lockdown policies has had unprecedented impacts on air quality globally. This study is an attempt to assess the effects of COVID-19 induced lockdown measures on air quality in both regional, country, and city scales in the South and Southeast Asian region using open-source satellite-based data and software frameworks. We performed a systematic review of the national lockdown measures of 19 countries of the study area based on publicly available materials. We considered two temporal settings over a period of 66 days to assess and compare the effects of lockdown measures on air quality levels between standard business as usual and current situation COVID-19 lockdown. Results showed that compared to the same period of 2019, atmospheric NO
Epidemiological and clinical features of 125 Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in Fuyang, Anhui, China;To investigate the epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID-19 in Anhui province of China.
COVID-19 transmission in Mainland China is associated with temperature and humidity: A time-series analysis;COVID-19 has become a pandemic. The influence of meteorological factors on the transmission and spread of COVID-19 is of interest. This study sought to examine the associations of daily average temperature (AT) and relative humidity (ARH) with the daily counts of COVID-19 cases in 30 Chinese provinces (in Hubei from December 1, 2019 to February 11, 2020 and in other provinces from January 20, 2020 to Februarys 11, 2020). A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was fitted to quantify the province-specific associations between meteorological variables and the daily cases of COVID-19 during the study periods. In the model, the 14-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of AT and ARH, and their interaction were included with time trend and health-seeking behavior adjusted. Their spatial distributions were visualized. AT and ARH showed significantly negative associations with COVID-19 with a significant interaction between them (0.04, 95% confidence interval: 0.004–0.07) in Hubei. Every 1 °C increase in the AT led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 36% to 57% when ARH was in the range from 67% to 85.5%. Every 1% increase in ARH led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 11% to 22% when AT was in the range from 5.04 °C to 8.2 °C. However, these associations were not consistent throughout Mainland China.
Kawasaki-like disease in children with COVID-19: A hypothesis;With rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome- corona virus-2 (SARS-COV-2) globally, some new aspects of the disease have been reported. Recently, it has been reported the incidence of Kawasaki-like disease among children with COVID-19. Since, children had been known to be less severely affected by the virus in part due to the higher concentration of Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptor, this presentation has emerged concerns regarding the infection of children with SARS-COV2. ACE2 has anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anti-proliferative characteristics through converting angiotensin (Ag)-II to Ang (1–7). ACE2 receptor is downregulated by the SARS-COV through the spike protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-S) via a process that is tightly coupled with Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production. TNF-α plays a key role in aneurysmal formation of coronary arteries in Kawasaki disease (KD). Affected children by COVID-19 with genetically-susceptible to KD might have genetically under-expression of ACE2 receptor that might further decrease the expression of ACE2 due to the downregulation of the receptor by the virus in these patients. It appears that TNF- α might be the cause and the consequence of the ACE2 receptor downregulation which results in arterial walls aneurysm. Conclusion: Genetically under-expression of ACE2 receptor in children with genetically-susceptible to KD who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 possibly further downregulates the ACE2 expression by TNF-α and leads to surge of inflammation including TNF-α and progression to Kawasaki-like disease.
Performance of the Quick COVID-19 Severity Index and the Brescia-COVID Respiratory Severity Scale in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a community hospital setting;To evaluate the performance of the Quick COVID-19 Severity Index (qCSI) and the Brescia-COVID Respiratory Severity Scale (BCRSS) in predicting ICU admissions and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
The paradoxical effect of IL-6 and implications for the use of Tocilizumab in Covid-19 patients;In the context of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, patients affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should be more vulnerable to Covid-19, whereas they seem to be protected against severe Covid-19. That paradox has important practical implications for the use of the drug Tocilizumab in Covid-19. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) orchestrates the so-called cytokine storm leading to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), the life-threatening condition that is responsible for Covid-19 deaths. However, IL-6 has a paradoxical effect in many viral infections. For pathogens such as HIV and Hepatitis B for example, high elevations show a toxic effect and are associated with higher mortality (e.g. they promote progression to AIDS in HIV patients), whereas mild elevations show a protective effect. IL-6 can be therefore considered as being both a pro-inflammatory and an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Several studies have shown that severe COPD is associated with extremely-high levels of IL-6, whereas mild COPD is associated with mild elevations of IL-6. It is plausible that the chronic, mildly-elevated concentrations of IL-6 found in mild COPD patients is protective against the deterioration of Covid-19, as it is the case for other viral diseases. That may explain why COPD is surprisingly an uncommon comorbidity in Covid-19 intensive care units. This may have an important practical implication for the treatment of Covid-19 patients: our hypothesis is that Tocilizumab must be used exclusively in patients with an ongoing cytokine storm. Otherwise, an early use of Tocilizumab can be harmful, especially in patients affected by COPD or other conditions with mildly-elevated IL-6.
Harnessing adenosine A2A receptors as a strategy for suppressing the lung inflammation and thrombotic complications of COVID-19: Potential of pentoxifylline and dipyridamole;Counterproductive lung inflammation and dysregulated thrombosis contribute importantly to the lethality of advanced COVID-19. Adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR), expressed by a wide range of immune cells, as well as endothelial cells and platelets, exert cAMP-mediated anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects that potentially could be highly protective in this regard. The venerable drug pentoxifylline (PTX) exerts both anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects that reflect its ability to boost the responsiveness of A2AR to extracellular adenosine. The platelet-stabilizing drug dipyridamole (DIP) blocks intracellular uptake of extracellularly-generated adenosine, thereby up-regulating A2AR signaling in a way that should be functionally complementary to the impact of PTX in that regard. Moreover, DIP has recently been reported to slow the cellular replication of SARS-CoV-2 in clinically feasible concentrations. Both PTX and DIP are reasonably safe, well-tolerated, widely available, and inexpensive drugs. When COVID-19 patients can be treated within several days of symptom onset, using PTX + DIP in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and an antibiotic – azithromycin (AZM) or doxycycline – might be warranted. HCQ and AZM can suppress SARS-CoV-2 proliferation in vitro and may slow the cell-to-cell spread of the virus
COVID-19: Endogenous Retinoic Acid Theory and Retinoic Acid Depletion Syndrome;This study presents two new concepts and definitions to the medical literature. One of those is “endogenous retinoic acid theory” and the other “retinoic acid depletion syndrome”. A new classification will be provided for the immune system: “retinoic acid-dependent component” and “retinoic acid non-dependent component”. If this theory is verified, all the diseases where the retinoic acid metabolism is defective and retinoic acid levels are low will be identified and new approaches will be developed fortreating such diseases. When the need for retinoic acids increases, such as acute infection, high fever, severe catabolic process, or chronic antigenic stimulation, cytochrome oxidase enzymes are inhibited by drugs or internal mechanisms. Metabolism and excretion of retinoic acids stored in the liver are prevented. In this way, retinoic acid levels in the blood are raised to therapeutic levels. This is called “Endogenous Retinoic Acid Theory”. Retinoic acids also manage their metabolism through feedback mechanisms. Despite compensatory mechanisms, causes such as high fever, serious catabolic process and excessively large viral genome (SARS-CoV-2), excessive use of RIG-I and Type I interferon synthesis pathway using retinoic acid causes emptying of retinoic acid stores. As a result, the RIG-I pathway becomes ineffective, Type I IFN synthesis stops, and the congenital immune system collapses. Then the immune mechanism passes to TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, MDA5 and UPS pathways in the monocyte, macrophage, neutrophil and dendritic cells of the adaptive immune defense system that do not require retinoic acid. This leads to excessive TNFα and cytokine discharge from the pathway. With the depletion of retinoic acid stores as a result of this overuse, the immune defense mechanism switches from the congenital immune system to the adaptive immune system, where retinoic acids cannot be used. As a result of this depletion of retinoic acids, the shift of the immune system to the NFκB arm, which causes excessive cytokine release, is called “retinoic acid depletion syndrome”. COVID-19 and previously defined sepsis, SIRS and ARDS are each retinoic acid depletion syndrome. We claim that retinoic acid metabolism is defective in most inflammatory diseases, particularly COVID-19 (cytokine storm) sepsis, SIRS and ARDS. Finding a solution to this mechanism will bring a new perspective and treatment approach to such diseases.
Clinical features and dynamics of viral load in imported and non-imported patients with COVID-19;To compare the clinical characteristics and the dynamics of viral load between imported and non-imported patients with COVID-19.
Kawasaki disease shock syndrome or toxic shock syndrome in children and the relationship with COVID-19;Most pediatric patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms. However, in the last two months, first in Europe and recently in the United States, a small number of children have developed a more severe inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19, which often leads to hospitalization and sometimes requires intensive care. A potential relationship was observed, especially between the occurrence of the Kawasaki disease and viral upper respiratory tract infections.
Possible mechanisms responsible for acute coronary events in COVID-19;The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is primarily a respiratory pathogen and its clinical manifestations are dominated by respiratory symptoms, the most severe of which is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, COVID-19 is increasingly recognized to cause an overwhelming inflammatory response and cytokine storm leading to end organ damage. End organ damage to heart is one of the most severe complications of COVID-19 that increases the risk of death. We proposed a two-fold mechanism responsible for causing acute coronary events in patients with COVID-19 infection: Cytokine storm leading to rapid onset formation of new coronary plaques along with destabilization of pre-existing plaques and direct myocardial injury secondary to acute systemic viral infection. A well-coordinated immune response is the first line innate immunity against a viral infection. However, an uncoordinated response and hypersecretion of cytokines and chemokines lead to immune related damage to the human body. Human Coronavirus (HCoV) infection causes infiltration of inflammatory cells that cause excessive production of cytokines, proteases, coagulation factors, oxygen radicals and vasoactive molecules causing endothelial damage, disruption of fibrous cap and initiation of formation of thrombus. Systemic viral infections also cause vasoconstriction leading to narrowing of vascular lumen and stimulation of platelet activation via shear stress. The resultant cytokine storm causes secretion of hypercoagulable tissue factor without consequential increase in counter-regulatory pathways such as AT-III, activated protein C and plasminogen activator type 1. Lastly, influx of CD4+ T-cells in cardiac vasculature results in an increased production of cytokines that stimulate smooth muscle cells to migrate into the intima and generate collagen and other fibrous products leading to advancement of fatty streaks to advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Direct myocardial damage and cytokine storm leading to destabilization of pre-existing plaques and accelerated formation of new plaques are the two instigating mechanisms for acute coronary syndromes in COVID-19.
Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays as a rapid diagnostic for COVID-19;Recently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2
Individual quarantine versus active monitoring of contacts for the mitigation of COVID-19: a modelling study;Voluntary individual quarantine and voluntary active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies for emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Given the impact of quarantine on resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions individual quarantine can more effectively control COVID-19 than active monitoring. As an epidemic grows, it is also important to consider when these interventions are no longer feasible and broader mitigation measures must be implemented.
COVID-19 lockdown measures reveal human impact on water transparency in the Venice Lagoon;The lagoon of Venice has always been affected by the regional geomorphological evolution, anthropogenic stressors and global changes. Different morphological settings and variable biogeophysical conditions characterize this continuously evolving system that rapidly responds to the anthropic impacts. When the lockdown measures were enforced in Italy to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on March 10th 2020, the ordinary urban water traffic around Venice, one of the major pressures in the lagoon, came to a halt. This provided a unique opportunity to analyse the environmental effects of restrictions to mobility on water transparency. Pseudo true-colour composites Sentinel-2 satellite imagery proved useful for qualitative visual interpretation, showing the reduction of the vessel traffic and their wakes from the periods before and during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. A quantitative analysis of suspended matter patterns, based on satellite-derived turbidity, in the absence of traffic perturbations, allowed to focus on natural processes and the residual stress from human activities that continued throughout the lockdown. We conclude that the high water transparency can be considered as a transient condition determined by a combination of natural seasonal factors and the effects of COVID-19 restrictions.
Chilblain-like acral lesions during the COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID toes”): Histologic, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemical study of 17 cases;During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, several acral chilblain-like lesions were observed in young patients with suspected, but mostly unconfirmed, infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The histopathologic aspect of these lesions is as yet poorly known.
First report on clinical and radiological features of COVID-19 pneumonitis in a Caucasian population: Factors predicting fibrotic evolution;At the end of February, the Lombardy region (Northern Italy) was involved in the pandemic spread of the new COVID-19. We here summarize the clinical and radiological characteristics of 90 confirmed cases and analyze their role in predicting the evolution of fibrosis.
Neuropsychiatric aspects of COVID-19 pandemic: A selective review;Corona virus disease (COVID-19) has been declared as a controllable pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 though is a predominantly respiratory illness
Neurosensory dysfunction: A diagnostic marker of early COVID-19;To describe neurosensory dysfunctions, including hyposmia, hypogeusia, and tinnitus, in patients with COVID-19.
Temperature significantly changes COVID-19 transmission in (sub)tropical cities of Brazil;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has become a severe public health issue. The novelty of the virus prompts a search for understanding of how ecological factors affect the transmission and survival of the virus. Several studies have robustly identified a relationship between temperature and the number of cases. However, there is no specific study for a tropical climate such as Brazil. This work aims to determine the relationship of temperature to COVID-19 infection for the state capital cities of Brazil.
Containing the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Meteorological factors and control strategies;The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally and the meteorological factors vary greatly across the world. Understanding the effect of meteorological factors and control strategies on COVID-19 transmission is critical to contain the epidemic. Using individual-level data in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and the number of confirmed cases in other regions, we explore the effect of temperature, relative humidity, and control measures on the spread of COVID-19. We find that high temperature mitigates the transmission of the disease. High relative humidity promotes COVID-19 transmission when temperature is low, but tends to reduce transmission when temperature is high. Implementing classical control measures can dramatically slow the spread of the disease. However, due to the occurrence of pre-symptomatic infections, the effect of the measures to shorten treatment time is markedly reduced and the importance of contact quarantine and social distancing increases.
Review of adverse cutaneous reactions of pharmacologic interventions for COVID-19: A guide for the dermatologist;The new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is associated with a wide variety of cutaneous manifestations. Although new skin manifestations caused by COVID-19 are continuously being described, other cutaneous entities should also be considered in the differential diagnosis, including adverse cutaneous reactions to drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 infections. The aim of this review is to provide dermatologists with an overview of the cutaneous adverse effects associated with the most frequently prescribed drugs in patients with COVID-19. The skin reactions of antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin with or without interferon, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and darunavir), and treatments for complications (imatinib, tocilizumab, anakinra, immunoglobulins, corticosteroids, colchicine and low molecular weight heparins) are analyzed. Information regarding possible skin reactions, their frequency, management, and key points for differential diagnosis are presented.
Co-infections in people with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis;In previous influenza pandemics, bacterial co-infections have been a major cause of mortality. We aimed to evaluate the burden of co-infections in patients with COVID-19.
Use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID-19: How good is the quality of randomized controlled trials?;We critically evaluated the quality of evidence and quality of harm reporting in clinical trials that evaluated the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or chloroquine (CQ) for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Ac2-26 mimetic peptide of annexin A1 to treat severe COVID-19: A hypothesis;The Coronavirus Diseases-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic leads many researchers around the world to study the SARS-CoV-s2 infection and pathology to find a treatment for it. This generates a massive production of papers including pre-clinical, clinical and revisions but till now no specific treatment were identified. Meanwhile, like other coronavirus infections, COVID-19 leads to the cytokine storm syndrome resulting in hyperinflammation, exacerbated immune response and multiple organ dysfunctions indicating that drugs that modulate this response, as glucocorticoids could be a treatment option. However glucocorticoids have several side effects or usage limitations. In this sense a drug with anti-inflammatory effects and capable to reduce inflammation but with less after-effects could be a powerful tool to combat COVID-19. Thus the Ac2-26 Mimetic Peptide of Annexin A1 emerges as a possible therapy. The peptide has many anti-inflammatory effects described including the reduction of interleukin (IL)-6, one of the main mediators of cytokine storm syndrome. Therefore the hypothesis to use the Ac2-26 peptide to treat severe COVID-19 will be highlighted in this paper.
Pandemic Risk of COVID-19 Outbreak in the United States: An Analysis of Network Connectedness with Air Travel Data;United States has become the country with the largest number of COVID-19 reported cases and deaths. This study aims to analyze the pandemic risk of COVID-19 outbreak in the US.
Comparing COVID-19 and the 1918–19 influenza pandemics in the United Kingdom;We compared the COVID-19 and 1918–19 influenza pandemics in the United Kingdom. We found that the ongoing COVID-19 wave of infection matched the major wave of the 1918–19 influenza pandemic surprisingly well, with both reaching similar magnitudes (in terms of estimated weekly new infections) and spending the same duration with over five cases per 1000 inhabitants over the previous two months. We also discussed the similarities in epidemiological characteristics between these two pandemics.
COVID-19: Loss of bridging between innate and adaptive immunity?;COVID-19 has spread to most countries in the world. However, there are some striking differences in how COVID-19 is behaving in different age groups. While data on COVID-19 is limited, children appear to be less susceptible to severe disease. These unique characteristics may be considered as a potential link to understanding the immune system and response in COVID-19 and lead to an effective cure to the disease. We suggest a possible role of loss of bridging between innate and adaptive immunity in COVID-19 and a potential treatment modality also discussed.
Household representative sample strategy for COVID-19 large-scale population screening;In the advent of COVID-19 pandemic, testing is highly essential to be able to identify, isolate, treat infected persons, and finally curb transmission of this infectious respiratory disease. Group testing has been used previously for various infectious diseases and recently reported for large-scale population testing of COVID-19. However, possible sample dilution as a result of large pool sizes has been reported, limiting testing methods’ detection sensitivity. Moreover, the need to sample all individuals prior to pooling overburden the limited resources such as test kits. An alternative proposed strategy where test is performed on pooled samples from individuals representing different households is presented here. This strategy intends to improve group testing method through the reduction in the number of samples collected and pooled during large-scale population testing. Moreover, it introduces database system which enables continuous monitoring of the population’s virus exposure for better decision making.
The epidemiology of COVID-19 cases and the successful containment strategy in Hong Kong–January to May 2020;Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, recorded its first confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case on 23 January 2020. We reviewed the case epidemiology and the various public health measures implemented from January to May 2020.
Ambient PM;It has been posited that populations being exposed to long-term air pollution are more susceptible to COVID-19. Evidence is emerging that long-term exposure to ambient PM
Clusters of COVID-19 associated with Purim celebration in the Jewish community in Marseille, France, March 2020;We investigated possible COVID-19 epidemic clusters and their common sources of exposure that led to a sudden increase in the incidence of COVID-19 in the Jewish community of Marseille between March 15 and March 20, 2020.
The time-varying transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and synchronous actions in China;We aimed to estimate the time-varying transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in China, Wuhan City and Guangdong province, and compared them with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
Washing hands and the face may reduce COVID-19 infection;The contribution of various modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been the subject of recent intensive debate. The predominant route of the viral transmission is via exhaled droplets of different sizes which can be inhaled by nearby exposed individuals or deposited on peoples and surfaces. Touching contaminated surfaces followed by hand to facial transfer has been identified as a potential infection route. As humans involuntarily touch their faces over 20 times per hour a hand washing with soap and water is recommended to avoid hands to face transmission. To date however, there is no clear explanation how the viruses arrive form the face into the nose and the lung. Our hypothesis is that during the physiological nasal air inspiration the virion particles attached on the face close to the nose are resuspended in the air and then are inhaled into the nose. Our preliminary fluid dynamics simulations confirm our hypothesis. Further experimental and computational studies are warranted.
Reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with severe COVID-19 disease by advancing ongoing trials of Mesenchymal Stromal (stem) Cell (MSC) therapy — Achieving global consensus and visibility for cellular host-directed therapies;As of May 17th 2020, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused 307,395 deaths worldwide, out of 3,917,366 cases reported to the World Health Organization. No specific treatments for reducing mortality or morbidity are yet available. Deaths from COVID-19 will continue to rise globally until effective and appropriate treatments and/or vaccines are found. In search of effective treatments, the global medical, scientific, pharma and funding communities have rapidly initiated over 500 COVID-19 clinical trials on a range of antiviral drug regimens and repurposed drugs in various combinations. A paradigm shift is underway from the current focus of drug development targeting the pathogen, to advancing cellular Host-Directed Therapies (HDTs) for tackling the aberrant host immune and inflammatory responses which underlie the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and high COVID-19 mortality rates. We focus this editorial specifically on the background to, and the rationale for, the use and evaluation of mesenchymal stromal (Stem) cells (MSCs) in treatment trials of patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Currently, the ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) report a combined 28 trials exploring the potential of MSCs or their products for treatment of COVID-19. MSCs should also be trialed for treatment of other circulating WHO priority Blueprint pathogens such as MERS-CoV which causes upto 34% mortality rates. It’s about time funding agencies invested more into development MSCs per se, and also for a range of other HDTs, in combination with other therapeutic interventions. MSC therapy could turn out to be an important contribution to bringing an end to the high COVID-19 death rates and preventing long-term functional disability in those who survive disease.
Increased Complement Receptor-3 levels in monocytes and granulocytes distinguish COVID-19 patients with pneumonia from those with mild symptoms;The reasons why some patients with COVID-19 develop pneumonia and others do not are unclear. To better understand this, we used multiparameter flow cytometry to profile circulating leukocytes from non-immunocompromised adult patients with PCR-proven COVID-19 and specifically compared those with mild symptoms with those who had developed pneumonia.

Clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients taking tumor necrosis factor inhibitors or methotrexate: A multicenter research network study;Data on the impact of biologics and immunomodulators on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)–related outcomes remain scarce.
Alcohol consumption and obesity: The hidden scare with COVID-19 severity;Obese individuals seem to be at the highest risk of contracting COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, severity of morbidity and mortality rates are higher in the developed world as compared to the developing world. One probable reason for this difference could be the difference in living conditions and exposure to other infections. Secondly, the difference in food especially, alcohol use may have deteriorating effects superimposed with obesity. Our hypothesis suggests that a combination of alcohol consumption and obesity causes low immunity and makes the individual prone to develop ‘cytokine storm’ and ‘acute respiratory distress syndrome’
Why do children seem to be more protected against COVID-19? A hypothesis;Today it remains unclear why children seem to be less likely to get infected by COVID-19 or why they appear to be less symptomatic after infections. All individuals, especially children, are exposed to various viruses including human coronavirus (CoVs) that can generally lead to respiratory infections. We hypothesize that recurrent CoVs exposure may induce an effective antiviral B and T-cell-mediated adaptive immune response, which could also be protective against COVID-19. Based on the high-homology between the Spike protein epitopes of taxonomically-related coronaviruses, we theorize that past/recurrent contact with CoVs might shield children also against the circulating COVID-19 through a possible neutralizing antibody response previously CoVs-induced. This would open up possible lines of research for the development of live-attenuated virus vaccines from CoVs. Future research is desirable to confirm or disprove such hypothesis.
On the crucial role of multilingual biomedical databases in epidemic events (SARS-CoV-2 analysis);The need for multilingual biomedical databases was already pointed out by different authors. They argue about the need for making translations available in other languages and centralized access to regional databases and that one should not disregard citations in other languages. This fact could not be any more real in the current situation regarding the novel coronavirus. When considering treatment, diagnosis and prevention, around 44% of the articles in PubMed were written in Chinese. This prompts the urgent need for quality automatic translation to make such extremely valuable information available to medical personnel in as many languages as possible. We also point out that the community should also make efforts to guarantee editorial quality and to follow the best practices in editing and publishing. This is of critical importance as well, such that the content is properly scrutinized before being published.
COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents;As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 continues to spread worldwide, there have been increasing reports from Europe, North America, Asia, and Latin America describing children and adolescents with COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory conditions. However, the association between multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and COVID-19 is still unknown. We review the epidemiology, causes, clinical features, and current treatment protocols for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents associated with COVID-19. We also discuss the possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for COVID-19-induced inflammatory processes, which can lead to organ damage in paediatric patients who are severely ill. These insights provide evidence for the need to develop a clear case definition and treatment protocol for this new condition and also shed light on future therapeutic interventions and the potential for vaccine development.
Independent association of meteorological characteristics with initial spread of Covid-19 in India;Whether weather plays a part in the transmissibility of the novel Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is still not established. We tested the hypothesis that meteorological factors (air temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, wind speed and rainfall) are independently associated with transmissibility of COVID-19 quantified using the basic reproduction rate (R
Sodium chromo-glycate and palmitoylethanolamide: A possible strategy to treat mast cell-induced lung inflammation in COVID-19;A novel human coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2 (also referred to as CoV-19) that emerged in late 2019 causes Covid-19 disease a respiratory tract infection which provokes about 4 million deaths per year. Unfortunately, to date, there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Mast cells (MCs) are immune cells implicated in the pathogenesis of viral infections, where they mediate inflammation. Microbes, including virus, activate MCs through TLR releasing chemical pro-inflammatory compounds and cytokines. Although, in biomedical literature there are only few reports on MCs activation by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by MC viral activation leads to increase pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Sodium Chromo-Glycate (SCG) described as a MC stabilizer, prevents the release of inflammatory chemical compounds, improve mouse survival and respiratory pathological changes in lung viral infection and suppresses inflammation. Furthermore, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) a nuclear factor agonist, an endogenous fatty acid amide, which exerts a variety of biological effects, related to chronic inflammation and pain, is involved also in MCs homeostasis with an inhibitory and protective effect on the respiratory tract during viral infections. Here, we hypothesize for the first time, that SCG and/or PEA suppress MC activation and pro-inflammatory mediators release, playing an anti-inflammatory therapeutic role in the inflamed lung of patients with COVID-19.

Estimating the impact of physical distancing measures in containing COVID-19: an empirical analysis;Epidemic modelling studies predict that physical distancing is critical in containing COVID-19. However, few empirical studies have validated this finding. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of different physical distancing measures in controlling viral transmission.
Natural and human environment interactively drive spread pattern of COVID-19: a city-level modeling study in China;A novel Coronavirus COVID-19 has caused high morbidity and mortality in China and worldwide. A few studies have explored the impact of climate change or human activity on the disease incidence in China or a city. The integrated study concerning environment impact on the emerging disease is rarely reported. Therefore, based on the two-stage modeling study, we investigate the effect of both natural and human environment on COVID-19 incidence at a city level. Besides, the interactive effect of different factors on COVID-19 incidence is analyzed using Geodetector

Early hydroxychloroquine but not chloroquine use reduces ICU admission in COVID-19 patients;The global push for the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) against COVID-19 has resulted in an ongoing discussion about the effectivity and toxicity of these drugs. Recent studies report no effect of (H)CQ on 28-day mortality. We investigated the effect of HCQ and CQ in hospitalized patients on the non-ICU COVID-ward.
Appropriate use of tocilizumab in COVID-19 infection;This study aimed to describe the effectiveness and optimum use of tocilizumab (TCZ) treatment by the support of clinical, laboratory and radiologic observations.
A hypothesis about the role of fetal hemoglobin in COVID-19;COVID-19 infection is less common in children (with higher fetal hemoglobin levels). In our preliminary study, we also observed a low prevalence and fatality of COVID-19 in countries with high rate of hemoglobinopathy carries. Given these two facts, the hemoglobin structure can play a role in the physiopathology of COVID-19 disease. Several drugs are known to increase fetal hemoglobin in adults. Adding these drugs to COVID-19 clinical trials may improve the patients’ outcomes.
Impact of weather on COVID-19 transmission in south Asian countries: An application of the ARIMAX model;We aimed to examine the impact of weather on COVID-19 confirmed cases in South Asian countries, namely, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.

Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist anakinra in association with remdesivir in severe COVID-19: A case report;We report the first successful treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra, in association with the most promising and available antiviral therapy, of a severe case of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We describe the diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case, including the respiratory failure at presentation, the progression to a scenario characterized by profound inflammatory dysregulation similar to that observed during macrophage activation syndrome, and the clinical improvement after treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra. This case highlights the high tolerability and the interesting immunomodulatory profile of the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra in the setting of severe COVID-19 associated with remdesivir therapy. Further studies are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of this combination strategy in the treatment of this emerging infection.
Can we contain the COVID-19 outbreak with the same measures as for SARS?;The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 resulted in more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths. SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine. By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated. By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths. Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19. COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread. Even if traditional public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths. Exportations to other countries need not result in rapid large-scale outbreaks, if countries have the political will to rapidly implement countermeasures.
Impacts of geographic factors and population density on the COVID-19 spreading under the lockdown policies of China;The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has a high spreading rate and a high fatality rate. To control the rapid spreading of COVID-19 virus, Chinese government ordered lockdown policies since late January 2020. The aims of this study are to quantify the relationship between geographic information (i.e., latitude, longitude and altitude) and cumulative infected population, and to unveil the importance of the population density in the spreading speed during the lockdown. COVID-19 data during the period from December 8, 2019 to April 8, 2020 were collected before and after lockdown. After discovering two important geographic factors (i.e., latitude and altitude) by estimating the correlation coefficients between each of them and cumulative infected population, two linear models of cumulative infected population and COVID-19 spreading speed were constructed based on these two factors. Overall, our findings from the models showed a negative correlation between the provincial daily cumulative COVID-19 infected number and latitude/altitude. In addition, population density is not an important factor in COVID-19 spreading under strict lockdown policies. Our study suggests that lockdown policies of China can effectively restrict COVID-19 spreading speed.

Transmission potential and severity of COVID-19 in South Korea;Since the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) identified on Jan 20, 2020, in South Korea, the number of cases rapidly increased, resulting in 6284 cases including 42 deaths as of Mar 6, 2020. To examine the growth rate of the outbreak, we present the first study to report the reproduction number of COVID-19 in South Korea.
Assessing air quality changes in large cities during COVID-19 lockdowns: The impacts of traffic-free urban conditions in Almaty, Kazakhstan;Number of cities worlwide experienced air quality improvements during COVID-19 lockdowns
Role of a habitat's air humidity in Covid-19 mortality;Transient local over-dry environment might be a contributor and an explanation for the observed asynchronous local rises in Covid-19 mortality. We propose that a habitat's air humidity negatively correlate with Covid-19 morbidity and mortality, and support this hypothesis on the example of publicly available data from German federal states.
Spatial analysis and GIS in the study of COVID-19. A review;This study entailed a review of 63 scientific articles on geospatial and spatial-statistical analysis of the geographical dimension of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The diversity of themes identified in this paper can be grouped into the following categories of disease mapping: spatiotemporal analysis, health and social geography, environmental variables, data mining, and web-based mapping. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 is essential for its mitigation, as it helps to clarify the extent and impact of the pandemic and can aid decision making, planning and community action. Health geography highlights the interaction of public health officials, affected actors and first responders to improve estimations of disease propagation and likelihoods of new outbreaks. Attempts at interdisciplinary correlation examine health policy interventions for the siting of health/sanitary services and controls, mapping/tracking of human movement, formulation of appropriate scientific and political responses and projection of spatial diffusion and temporal trends. This review concludes that, to fight COVID-19, it is important to face the challenges from an interdisciplinary perspective, with proactive planning, international solidarity and a global perspective. This review provides useful information and insight that can support future bibliographic queries, and also serves as a resource for understanding the evolution of tools used in the management of this major global pandemic of the 21 Century. It is hoped that its findings will inspire new reflections on the COVID-19 pandemic by readers.
Restructured society and environment: A review on potential technological strategies to control the COVID-19 pandemic;The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China at December 2019 had led to a global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the disease started to spread all over the world and became an international public health issue. The entire humanity has to fight in this war against the unexpected and each and every individual role is important. Healthcare system is doing exceptional work and the government is taking various measures that help the society to control the spread. Public, on the other hand, coordinates with the policies and act accordingly in most state of affairs. But the role of technologies in assisting different social bodies to fight against the pandemic remains hidden. The intention of our study is to uncover the hidden roles of technologies that ultimately help for controlling the pandemic. On investigating, it is found that the strategies utilizing potential technologies would yield better benefits and these technological strategies can be framed either to control the pandemic or to support the confinement of the society during pandemic which in turn aids in controlling the spreading of infection. This study enlightens the various implemented technologies that assists the healthcare systems, government and public in diverse aspects for fighting against COVID-19. Furthermore, the technological swift that happened during the pandemic and their influence in the environment and society is discussed. Besides the implemented technologies, this work also deals with untapped potential technologies that have prospective applications in controlling the pandemic circumstances. Alongside the various discussion, our suggested solution for certain situational issues is also presented.
Estimation of the potential spread risk of COVID-19: Occurrence assessment along the Yangtze, Han, and Fu River basins in Hubei, China;Given that the novel coronavirus was detected in stool and urine from diagnosed patients, the potential risk of its transmission through the water environment might not be ignored. In the current study, to investigate the spread possibility of COVID-19 via the environmental media, three typical rivers (Yangtze, Han, and Fu River) and watershed cities in Hubei province of China were selected, and a more comprehensive risk assessment analysis method was built with a risk index proposed. Results showed that the risk index in the Yangtze River Basin is about 10
COVID-19 water sector responses in Europe: A scoping review of preliminary governmental interventions;The unprecedented scale and impact of COVID-19 pandemic, and the accompanying lockdown implemented across many countries, has exacerbated water scarcity and security globally. Many European governments have introduced policy interventions to mitigate and protect their economies. Yet, water resources, which are a potential enabler in revitalising Europe's economy, have received few of such policy interventions since the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a public health emergency only in January 2020. Our scoping review of preliminary government responses of 27 European countries revealed that only 11 (40.7%) of these countries implemented at least one policy intervention that considered the water sector. These interventions were typically short-term measures involving either full cost absorption or deferment of water bills. Much attention on water governance and management processes, policies and financial investments required to augment the resilience of the water sector amid a growing scarcity of freshwater, triggered by extreme climate variation and also by COVID-19 pandemic should therefore be central to post COVID-19 recovery efforts in Europe. This paper also proposes future research directions, including a study that will harmonise water demand and consumption trends during the pandemic in Europe and an assessment on how the water sector can withstand possible external shocks in future.
Association between short-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 infection: Evidence from China;The novel coronavirus pneumonia, namely COVID-19, has become a global public health problem. Previous studies have found that air pollution is a risk factor for respiratory infection by carrying microorganisms and affecting body's immunity. This study aimed to explore the relationship between ambient air pollutants and the infection caused by the novel coronavirus. Daily confirmed cases, air pollution concentration and meteorological variables in 120 cities were obtained from January 23, 2020 to February 29, 2020 in China. We applied a generalized additive model to investigate the associations of six air pollutants (PM
The effects of regional climatic condition on the spread of COVID-19 at global scale;The pandemic outbreak of the novel coronavirus epidemic disease (COVID-19) is spreading like a diffusion-reaction in the world and almost 208 countries and territories are being affected around the globe. It became a sever health and socio-economic problem, while the world has no vaccine to combat this virus. This research aims to analyze the connection between the fast spread of COVID-19 and regional climate parameters over a global scale. In this research, we collected the data of COVID-19 cases from the time of 1st reported case to the 5th June 2020 in different affected countries and regional climatic parameters data from January 2020 to 5th June 2020. It was found that most of the countries located in the relatively lower temperature region show a rapid increase in the COVID-19 cases than the countries locating in the warmer climatic regions despite their better socio-economic conditions. A correlation between metrological parameters and COVID-19 cases was observed. Average daylight hours are correlated to total the COVID-19 cases with a coefficient of determination of 0.42, while average high-temperature shows a correlation of 0.59 and 0.42 with total COVID-19 cases and death cases respectively. The finding of the study will help international health organizations and local administrations to combat and well manage the spread of COVID-19.
TEMPORARY REMOVAL: Characteristics of deaths amongst health workers in China during the outbreak of COVID-19 infection;The Publisher regrets that this article has been temporarily removed. A replacement will appear as soon as possible in which the reason for the removal of the article will be specified, or the article will be reinstated.
Asymmetric nexus between temperature and COVID-19 in the top ten affected provinces of China: A current application of quantile-on-quantile approach;The present study examines the asymmetrical effect of temperature on COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease) from 22 January 2020 to 31 March 2020 in the 10 most affected provinces in China. This study used the Sim & Zhou' quantile-on-quantile (QQ) approach to analyze how the temperature quantities affect the different quantiles of COVID-19. Daily COVID-19 and, temperature data collected from the official websites of the Chinese National Health Commission and Weather Underground Company (WUC) respectively. Empirical results have shown that the relationship between temperature and COVID-19 is mostly positive for Hubei, Hunan, and Anhui, while mostly negative for Zhejiang and Shandong provinces. The remaining five provinces Guangdong, Henan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Heilongjiang are showing the mixed trends. These differences among the provinces can be explained by the differences in the number of COVID-19 cases, temperature, and the province's overall hospital facilitations. The study concludes that maintaining a safe and comfortable atmosphere for patients while COVID-19 is being treated may be rational.
Global association between satellite-derived nitrogen dioxide (NO;The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected various aspects of life, at different levels and in different countries on almost every continent. In response, many countries have closed their borders and imposed lockdown policies, possibly bringing benefits to people’s health with significantly less emission from air pollutants. Currently, most studies or reports are based on local observations at the city or country level. There remains a lack of systematic understanding of the impacts of different lockdown policies on the air quality from a global perspective. This study investigates the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic towards global air quality through examining global nitrogen dioxide (NO
Pulmonary post-mortem findings in a series of COVID-19 cases from northern Italy: a two-centre descriptive study;COVID-19 is characterised by respiratory symptoms, which deteriorate into respiratory failure in a substantial proportion of cases, requiring intensive care in up to a third of patients admitted to hospital. Analysis of the pathological features in the lung tissues of patients who have died with COVID-19 could help us to understand the disease pathogenesis and clinical outcomes.
Voluntary collective isolation as a best response to COVID-19 for indigenous populations? A case study and protocol from the Bolivian Amazon;Indigenous communities worldwide share common features that make them especially vulnerable to the complications of and mortality from COVID-19. They also possess resilient attributes that can be leveraged to promote prevention efforts. How can indigenous communities best mitigate potential devastating effects of COVID-19? In Bolivia, where nearly half of all citizens claim indigenous origins, no specific guidelines have been outlined for indigenous communities inhabiting native communal territories. In this Public Health article, we describe collaborative efforts, as anthropologists, physicians, tribal leaders, and local officials, to develop and implement a multiphase COVID-19 prevention and containment plan focused on voluntary collective isolation and contact-tracing among Tsimane forager-horticulturalists in the Bolivian Amazon. Phase 1 involves education, outreach, and preparation, and phase 2 focuses on containment, patient management, and quarantine. Features of this plan might be exported and adapted to local circumstances elsewhere to prevent widespread mortality in indigenous communities.
Repositioning of pentoxifylline as an immunomodulator and regulator of the renin-angiotensin system in the treatment of COVID-19;Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, which in turn activate protein kinase, leading to a reduction in the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines to ultimately influence the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)

Demographic shift in COVID-19 patients in Singapore from an aged, at-risk population to young, migrant workers with reduced risk of severe disease;The vast majority of COVID-19 cases in Singapore occurred amongst migrant workers. We examined trends in the hospitalised cases and tested the assumption that the low severity of disease had been related to the relatively young population affected.
Repercussions of COVID-19 pandemic on municipal solid waste management: Challenges and opportunities;The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global emergency and has raised social and economic concerns which will also spill over to environmental issues. Amid this natural experiment, current study evaluates prevailing municipal solid waste (MSW) management practices, with the emphasis on MSW treatment and disposal facilities in select developed and developing countries. The data and information used in this paper is collected from several scientific research papers from different disciplines, publications from governments and multilateral agencies and media reports. Despite limited literature on MSW management during such pandemics, this article presets a global backdrop of MSW management during COVID-19 outbreak and examines various aspects of MSW management. Discussion includes identifying parameters of disease transmission through solid waste handling, consequences of medical waste surge on current municipal waste treatment and disposal systems. Further, based on previous pandemic and disaster waste management studies, this study also presents challenges and opportunities in the aftermath of the ongoing pandemic. The paper recommends alternatives approaches for MSW treatment and disposal and outlines the future scope of work to achieve sustainable waste management during and aftermath of the pandemics.
Association of contact to small children with a mild course of COVID-19;It is known that severe COVID-19 cases in small children are rare. If a childhood-related infection were protective against a severe course of COVID-19, it would be expected that adults with intensive and regular contact with small children also may have a mild course of COVID-19 more frequently. To test this hypothesis, a survey among 4010 recovered COVID-19 patients was conducted in Germany. 1186 complete answers were collected. 6.9% of these patients reported frequent and regular job-related contact with children below ten years of age, and 23.2% had their own small children, which was higher than expected. In the relatively small subgroup with intensive care treatment (n = 19), patients without contact with small children were overrepresented. These findings are not well explained by age, gender, or BMI distribution of those patients and should be validated in other settings.
Aberrant hyperactivation of cytotoxic T-cell as a potential determinant of COVID-19 severity;We hypothesized that immune response may contribute to progression of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) at the second week of illness. Therefore, we compared cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses between severe and mild COVID-19 cases.
Viral dynamics in asymptomatic patients with COVID-19;Data are limited on the viral load, viral shedding patterns, and potential infectivity of asymptomatic patients (APs) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study included 31 adult patients who were virologically confirmed to have COVID-19 but were asymptomatic on admission. Among these 31 patients, 22 presented symptoms after admission and were defined as asymptomatic patients in the incubation period (APIs)
Diversity lost: COVID-19 as a phenomenon of the total environment;If we want to learn how to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have to embrace the complexity of this global phenomenon and capture interdependencies across scales and contexts. Yet, we still lack systematic approaches that we can use to deal holistically with the pandemic and its effects. In this Discussion, we first introduce a framework that highlights the systemic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of the total environment as a self-regulating and evolving system comprising of three spheres, the Geosphere, the Biosphere, and the Anthroposphere. Then, we use this framework to explore and organize information from the rapidly growing number of scientific papers, preprints, preliminary scientific reports, and journalistic pieces that give insights into the pandemic crisis. With this work, we point out that the pandemic should be understood as the result of preconditions that led to depletion of human, biological, and geochemical diversity as well as of feedback that differentially impacted the three spheres. We contend that protecting and promoting diversity, is necessary to contribute to more effective decision-making processes and policy interventions to face the current and future pandemics.
A potentially effective treatment for COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis of convalescent plasma therapy in treating severe infectious disease;Convalescent plasma (CP) has been used successfully to treat many types of infectious disease, and has shown initial effects in the treatment of the emerging 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, its curative effects and feasibility have yet to be confirmed by formal evaluation and well-designed clinical trials. To explore the effectiveness of treatment and predict the potential effects of CP with COVID-19, studies of different types of infectious disease treated with CP were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis.
Periodontal disease and targeted prevention using aMMP-8 point-of-care oral fluid analytics in the COVID-19 era;Periodontal disease is a chronic multifactorial infectious and inflammatory disease associated with several chronic systemic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, Alzheimer’s disease and so on. These same systemic diseases have been associated with severe COVID-19 infections. Several recent studies have suggested hypotheses for the potential association between periodontal disease and severe COVID-19. Periodontal disease is also one of the most prevalent diseases globally. All this supports the importance of good oral health, also in the COVID-19 era. Thus, new strategies and approaches to identify patients at risk of periodontal disease could be beneficial to enhance secondary prevention, especially if targeted to COVID-19 risk groups. Diagnostic biomarkers for periodontal disease have been researched extensively. Potential biomarkers in oral fluid with currently available rapid non-invasive point-of-care technology, such as aMMP-8, could help to extend screening and identification of patients at risk for periodontal disease also to situations and places where professional dental expertise and equipment are limited or unavailable. i.e., nursing and care homes, and rural and distant places. The oral fluid point-of-care technologies could also be useful in the hands of medical professionals (diabetes, CVD, etc.) to identify patients at risk for undiagnosed periodontal disease and to refer them to a dentist for examination and evaluation. Finally, if there is a causality between periodontal disease and severe COVID-19 infections, these point-of-care oral fluid biomarker technologies could possibly also help in the assessment of the risk of deterioration and complications.
Impact of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China;A COVID-19 outbreak emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and developed into a global pandemic during March 2020. The effects of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in China are unknown. Data on COVID-19 daily confirmed cases and daily mean temperatures were collected from 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China between Jan. 20 and Feb. 29, 2020. Locally weighted regression and smoothing scatterplot (LOESS), distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs), and random-effects meta-analysis were used to examine the relationship between daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 and temperature conditions. The daily number of new cases peaked on Feb. 12, and then decreased. The daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 had a biphasic relationship with temperature (with a peak at 10 °C), and the daily incidence of COVID-19 decreased at values below and above these values. The overall epidemic intensity of COVID-19 reduced slightly following days with higher temperatures with a relative risk (RR) was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). A random-effect meta-analysis including 28 provinces in mainland China, we confirmed the statistically significant association between temperature and RR during the study period (Coefficient = −0.0100, 95% CI: −0.0125, −0.0074). The DLNMs in Hubei Province (outside of Wuhan) and Wuhan showed similar patterns of temperature. Additionally, a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model, with adjustment for climatic factors, was used to provide a complete characterization of the impact of climate on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic.
Can we predict the occurrence of COVID-19 cases? Considerations using a simple model of growth;This study aimed to present a simple model to follow the evolution of the COVID-19 (CV-19) pandemic in different countries. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) and its first derivative were employed for this task. The simulations showed that it is almost impossible to predict based on the initial CV-19 cases (1st 2nd or 3rd weeks) how the pandemic will evolve. However, the results presented here revealed that this approach can be used as an alternative for the exponential growth model, traditionally employed as a prediction model, and serve as a valuable tool for investigating how protective measures are changing the evolution of the pandemic.
COVID-19: Lessons for the climate change emergency;The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak pandemic is now a global crisis. It has caused 9+ million confirmed cases and 400,000+ deaths at the time of writing and triggered unprecedented preventative measures that have confined a substantial portion of the global population and established ‘social distancing’ as a new global behavioral norm. The COVID-19 crisis has affected all aspects of everyday life and work, and heavily impacted the global economy. This crisis also offers unprecedented insights into how the global climate crisis may be managed, as there are many parallels between the COVID-19 crisis and what we expect from the imminent global climate emergency. Reflecting upon the challenges of today's crisis may help us better prepare for the future. Here we compile a list, by no means comprehensive, of the similarities and differences between the two crises, and the lessons we can learn from them: (i) High momentum trends, (ii) Irreversible changes, (iii) Social and spatial inequality, (iv) Weakening of international solidarity, and (v) Less costly to prevent than to cure.
Mild versus severe COVID-19: Laboratory markers;The number of COVID-19 patients is dramatically increasing worldwide. Treatment in intensive care units (ICU) has become a major challenge
Influenza-negative influenza-like illness (fnILI) Z-score as a proxy for incidence and mortality of COVID-19;Although direct detection of SARS-CoV2 in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals is the ideal epidemiological tool for determining the burden of disease, the lack of availability of testing can preclude its wider implementation as a robust surveillance system. We correlated the use of the derivative influenza-negative influenza-like illness (fnILI) z-score from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a proxy for incident cases and disease-specific deaths. For every unit increase of fnILI z-score, the number of cases increased by 376.5 (95% CI [202.5, 550.5]) and number of deaths increased by 10.2 (95% CI [5.4, 15.0]). FnILI data may serve as an accurate outcome measurement to track the spread of COVID-19 infection and disease, and allow for informed and timely decision-making on public health interventions.
Methylene blue may have a role in the treatment of COVID-19;In this paper, we raise the hypothesis that Methylene Blue may be a treatment option for Corona Virus Disease of 2019 specially when combined with Non Steroid Anti-Inflammatory Drugs. In previous publications including ours, the role of kininogen system has been postulated. A correlation between clinical findings of the disease and this mechanism has been drawn to denote a pivotal role of kininogen-kallikrein system in pathophysiology of the disease. Therein the possible role of Icatibant, Ecallantide and Aprotinin in the treatment of this disease has been raised. Here we want to emphasize on an important post-receptor mechanism of bradykinin that is Nitric Oxide. We came to this aim because we found out how access to these novel treatment nominees may be expensive and unaffordable. For this reason we are focusing on possible role of an old albeit “mysterious” drug namely Methylene Blue. This medication may abort effects of Bradykinin by inhibition of Nitric Oxide synthase inhibitor and promote oxygen saturation while it is inexpensive and ubiquitously accessible. Clinical studies cannot be over emphasized.
A mechanism-based parameterisation scheme to investigate the association between transmission rate of COVID-19 and meteorological factors on plains in China;The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which first emerged in Hubei province, China, has become a pandemic. However, data regarding the effects of meteorological factors on its transmission are limited and inconsistent. A mechanism-based parameterisation scheme was developed to investigate the association between the scaled transmission rate (STR) of COVID-19 and the meteorological parameters in 20 provinces/municipalities located on the plains in China. We obtained information on the scale of population migrated from Wuhan, the world epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak, into the study provinces/municipalities using mobile-phone positioning system and big data techniques. The highest STRs were found in densely populated metropolitan areas and in cold provinces located in north-eastern China. Population density had a non-linear relationship with disease spread (linearity index, 0.9). Among various meteorological factors, only temperature was significantly associated with the STR after controlling for the effect of population density. A negative and exponential relationship was identified between the transmission rate and the temperature (correlation coefficient, −0.56
Contact tracing with digital assistance in Taiwan’s COVID-19 outbreak response;Comprehensive case investigation and contact tracing are crucial to prevent community spread of COVID-19. We demonstrated a utility of using traditional contact tracing measures supplemented with symptom tracking and contact management system to assist public health workers with high efficiency.
Rethinking interleukin-6 blockade for treatment of COVID-19;Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine with effects in immune regulation, inflammation, and infection. The use of drugs that inhibit IL-6 biological activity has been proposed as a treatment for patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rationale for this approach includes commitment to the concept that inflammation is a cause of lung damage in COVID-19 and belief that IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory molecule. Observational data thought to support IL-6 inhibition include elevated circulating IL-6 levels in COVID-19 patients and association between elevated IL-6 and poor clinical outcomes. However, IL-6 has significant anti-inflammatory properties, which calls into question the rationale for employing IL-6 blockade to suppress inflammation-induced tissue injury. Also, studies suggesting a beneficial role for IL-6 in the host response to infection challenge the strategy of using IL-6 blockade to treat COVID-19. In studies of recombinant IL-6 injected into human volunteers, IL-6 levels exceeding those measured in COVID-19 patients have been observed with no pulmonary adverse events or other organ damage. These observations question the role of IL-6 as a contributing factor in COVID-19. Clinical experience with IL-6 receptor antagonists such as tocilizumab demonstrates increase in severe and opportunistic infections, raising concern about using tocilizumab and similar agents to treat COVID-19. Trials of drugs to inhibit IL-6 activity in COVID-19 are ongoing and will shed light on the role of IL-6 in COVID-19 pathogenesis. However, until more information is available, providers should exercise caution in prescribing these therapies given the potential for patient harm.
Can chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine prove efficient in cancer cachexia? A hypothesis in the era of COVID-19;Cancer cachexia is a progressive loss of muscle mass (with or without a decrease of adipose tissue). Gradual deterioration of the patient's fitness is resistant to nutritional intervention. The biochemical foundation of observed catabolism, detrimental protein, and energy balance is composite. However, the generalized inflammatory response plays a vital role. It is a kind of cytokine storm, which involves increased activity of TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and INF-γ. Pharmacological treatment of cachexia consists mainly of progestagens and glucocorticosteroids. Still, the assessment of new options limiting the harmful impact of cachexia could be beneficial. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are old antimalarial agents endowed with immunomodulatory properties. Being potent autophagy inhibitors, they could lead to some kind of intracellular starvation in both immunocompetent effector cells and cancer cells, thus limiting the harmful impact of CC. CQ/HCQ are also efficient in particular connective tissue disorders. They have gained special attention since the World Health Organization announced the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. According to initial reports, people with a severe inflammatory reaction achieved significant benefits. Possibly they could not be attributed to the antiviral activity alone. It is worth noting that the cytokine storm in COVID-19, connective tissue disorders, and cancer cachexia share some similarities. Therefore, we hypothesize that low doses of CQ/HCQ may prove efficient in cancer cachexia.
COVID-19 mortality in patients with cancer on chemotherapy or other anticancer treatments: a prospective cohort study;Individuals with cancer, particularly those who are receiving systemic anticancer treatments, have been postulated to be at increased risk of mortality from COVID-19. This conjecture has considerable effect on the treatment of patients with cancer and data from large, multicentre studies to support this assumption are scarce because of the contingencies of the pandemic. We aimed to describe the clinical and demographic characteristics and COVID-19 outcomes in patients with cancer.
Effects of temperature and humidity on the daily new cases and new deaths of COVID-19 in 166 countries;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge facing the world. Meteorological parameters are reportedly crucial factors affecting respiratory infectious disease epidemics
Targeting adenosinergic pathway and adenosine A;The most serious health issue today is the rapid outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). More than 6,973,427 confirmed cases were diagnosed in nearly 213 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances, causing globally over 400,000 deaths. Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients have been identified, but the factors influencing the immune system against COVID-19 have not been well established. Upon infection or cell damage, high amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are released from damaged cells, which serve as mediators of inflammation through purinergic cell surface receptor signaling. As a protective mechanism to prevent excessive damage to host tissue, adenosine counteracts ATP's effects by adenosine receptor stimulation to suppress the pro-inflammatory response. Adenosine is seen as a major obstacle to the efficacy of immune therapies, and the adenosinergic axis components are critical therapeutic targets for cancer and microbial infections. Pharmacologic inhibitors or antibodies specific to adenosinergic pathway components or adenosine receptors in microbial and tumor therapy have shown efficacy in pre-clinical studies and are entering the clinical arena. In this review, we provide a novel hypothesis explaining the potential for improving the efficiency of innate and adaptive immune systems by targeting adenosinergic pathway components and adenosine A
Beneficial effect of corticosteroids in preventing mortality in patients receiving tocilizumab to treat severe COVID-19 illness;To assess the characteristics and risk factors for mortality in patients with severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) treated with tocilizumab (TCZ), alone or in combination with corticosteroids (CS).
A vulnerability-based approach to human-mobility reduction for countering COVID-19 transmission in London while considering local air quality;An ecologic analysis was conducted to explore the correlation between air pollution, and COVID-19 cases and fatality rates in London. The analysis demonstrated a strong correlation (R
Reflection on lower rates of COVID-19 in children: Does childhood immunizations offer unexpected protection?;The incidence of COVID-19 in children and teenagers is only about 2% in China. Children had mild symptoms and hardly infected other children or adults. It is worth considering that children are the most vulnerable to respiratory pathogens, but fatal SARS-like virus had not caused severe cases among them. According to the pathological studies of COVID-19 and SARS, a sharp decrease in T lymphocytes leads to the breakdown of the immune system. The cellular immune system of children differs from that of adults may be the keystone of atypical clinical manifestations or even covert infection. The frequent childhood vaccinations and repeated pathogens infections might be resulting in trained immunity of innate immune cells, immune fitness of adaptive immune cells or cross-protection of antibodies in the children. Therefore, due to lack of specific vaccine, some vaccines for tuberculosis, influenza and pneumonia may have certain application potential for the front-line health workers in the prevention and control of COVID-19. However, for high-risk susceptible populations, such as the elderly with basic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, it is necessary to explore the remedial effect of the planned immune process on their immunity to achieve the trained immunity or immune fitness, so as to improve their own antiviral ability.
Iron: Innocent bystander or vicious culprit in COVID-19 pathogenesis?;The coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is viciously spreading through the continents with rapidly increasing mortality rates. Current management of COVID-19 is based on the premise that respiratory failure is the leading cause of mortality. However, mounting evidence links accelerated pathogenesis in gravely ill COVID-19 patients to a hyper-inflammatory state involving a cytokine storm. Several components of the heightened inflammatory state were addressed as therapeutic targets. Another key component of the heightened inflammatory state is hyper-ferritinemia which reportedly identifies patients with increased mortality risk. In spite of its strong association with mortality, it is not yet clear if hyper-ferritinemia in COVID-19 patients is merely a systemic marker of disease progression, or a key modulator in disease pathogenesis. Here we address implications of a possible role for hyper-ferritinemia, and altered iron homeostasis in COVID-19 pathogenesis, and potential therapeutic targets in this regard.
Smart polymeric eye gear: A possible preventive measure against ocular transmission of COVID-19;The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE-2) receptors with approx. 0.8% congestion in conjunctival surface, leads to increase susceptibility of Covid-19 transmission through ocular surface. It has been observed that prophylactic measures such as goggle or face shield are unable to offer complete protection against ocular transmission of SRS-CoV-2. Hence, it is hypothesized that topical ocular prophylaxis using biocompatible polymers with reported 
Potential role of statins in COVID-19;Patients with COVID-19 infection have an increased risk of cardiovascular complications and thrombotic events. Statins are known for their pleiotropic anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and immunomodulatory effects. They may have a potential role as adjunctive therapy to mitigate endothelial dysfunction and dysregulated inflammation in patients with COVID-19 infection.
The Spread of COVID-19 and Policy Responses in Vietnam: An Overview;Despite the proximity and high travel flows with China, Vietnam has been able to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study describes the characteristics of COVID-19 infections in Vietnam and policy responses to identify potential factors contributing to the relative success of Vietnam in containing this pandemic.
Meteorological impact on the COVID-19 pandemic: A study across eight severely affected regions in South America;The role of meteorological factors in the transmission of the COVID-19 still needs to be determined. In this study, the daily new cases of the eight severely affected regions in four countries of South America and their corresponding meteorological data (average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average wind speed, visibility, absolute humidity) were collected. Daily number of confirmed and incubative cases, as well as time-dependent reproductive number (R

Hydrogen peroxide and viral infections: A literature review with research hypothesis definition in relation to the current covid-19 pandemic;We reviewed the literature concerning the innate response from nasal and oral epithelial cells and their reaction to hydrogen peroxide (H
Decarceration and community re-entry in the COVID-19 era;Jails and prisons are exceptionally susceptible to viral outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The USA has extremely high rates of incarceration and COVID-19 is causing an urgent health crisis in correctional facilities and detention centres. Epidemics happening in prisons are compounding the elevated risks that COVID-19 poses to people of colour, older people, and those with comorbidities. Intersectoral community re-entry efforts in the USA and other countries have shown that releasing people from correctional facilities as a pandemic-era public health intervention is safe and can support both public safety and community rebuilding. Therefore, substantial decarceration in the USA should be initiated. A point of focus for such efforts is that many people in prison are serving excessively long sentences and pose acceptable safety risks for release. Properly managed, correctional depopulation will prevent considerable COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and reduce prevailing socioeconomic and health inequities.
Use of anakinra in severe COVID-19: A case report;Coronavirus disease 19 is a global healthcare emergency with a high lethality rate. Relevant inflammatory cytokine storm is associated with severity of disease, and IL1 inhibition is a cornerstone treatment for hyperinflammatory diseases. We present here the case of a patient with critical COVID-19 successfully treated with IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra).
IL-17A and TNF-α as potential biomarkers for acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality in patients with obesity and COVID-19;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic and international health emergency by the World Health Organization. Patients with obesity with COVID-19 are 7 times more likely to need invasive mechanical ventilation than are patients without obesity (OR 7.36
Analysis of the predictive factors for a critical illness of COVID-19 during treatment － relationship between serum zinc level and critical illness of COVID-19 −;Because most severely ill patients with COVID-19 in our hospital showed zinc deficiency, we aimed to examine the relationship between the patient’s serum zinc level and severe cases of COVID-19.
Impact of COVID-19 on environmental noise emitted from the port;Identification of noise sources and their ranking is a crucial part of any noise abatement program. This is a particularly difficult task when a complex source, such as a seaport, is considered. COVID -19 epidemic has had a significant impact on environmental noise related to road, rail, air and ship traffic and provided a unique opportunity to observe immediate noise reduction. In order to identify the noise sources, whose reduction was most effective in reducing noise from the port area, this study compared and quantified noise emissions between the historical and epidemic periods. Environmental noise measurements from three noise monitoring stations at the port boundary were analysed. In addition, noise emissions from ship, road, rail and industry as well as meteorological data in the historical pre – COVID -19 (January 2018 - February 2020) and COVID-19 (April 2020) period were analysed in detail. The characteristics of the noise sources mentioned, geographical data and noise measurements were used to develop and validate a noise model of the port area, which was used to calculate noise contour maps. Our results show that the reduction in noise levels observed at all monitoring stations coincides with the reduced shipping traffic. The A weighted equivalent sound pressure levels in the day, evening and night periods were reduced by 2.2 dB to 5.7 dB compared to the long-term averages, and the area of the 55 dB day-evening-night noise contour was reduced by 23 %. Compared to the historical period, the number of people exposed to noise levels above 55 dB(A) in the day-evening-night period due to shipping and industrial activities was reduced by 20% in the COVID -19 period. Such results show that environmental noise generated by moored ships is a problem for port cities that should be regulated internationally. In addition, this paper provides precise guidance on noise emission characteristics, ship categorisation and the post-processing of long-term measurement data, taking into account wind conditions and undesired sound events, which can be applied to future research at other locations near shipping ports and used to prepare strategies for noise reduction in ports.
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and control measures on air quality and aerosol light absorption in Southwestern China;China has been performing nationwide social lockdown by releasing the Level 1 response to major public health emergencies (RMPHE) to struggle against the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak since late January 2020. During the Level 1 RMPHE, social production and public transport were maintained at minimal levels, and residents stayed in and worked from home. The universal impact of anthropogenic activities on air pollution can be evaluated by comparing it with air quality under such extreme conditions. We investigated the concentration of both gaseous and particulate pollutants and aerosol light absorption at different levels of (RMPHE) in an urban area of southwestern China. During the lockdown, PM
Life-threatening course in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Is there a link to methylenetetrahydrofolic acid reductase (MTHFR) polymorphism and hyperhomocysteinemia?;As the current COVID-19 pandemic develops and epidemiological data reveals differences in geographical spread as well as risk factors for developing a severe course of illness, hypotheses regarding possible underlying mechanisms need to be developed and tested. In our hypothesis, we explore the rational for a role of MTHFR polymorphism C677T as a possible explanation for differences in geographical and gender distribution in disease severity. We also discuss the role of the resulting hyper-homocysteinemia, its interaction with the C677T polymorphism and its influence on immune state as well as risk factors for severe disease. Finally, we consider possible dietary ways to influence the underlying pathomechanisms prophylactically and supportively.
Patients with Covid-19 exhibit different immunological profiles according to their clinical presentation;A novel beta coronavirus has been identified as responsible for the 2019 coronavirus infection (Covid-19). Clinical presentations range from asymptomatic cases to acute respiratory distress syndrome with fatal outcome.

COVID-19 pandemic: Impacts on the air quality during the partial lockdown in São Paulo state, Brazil;In early March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic, and in late March 2020 partial lockdown was ordered by the São Paulo state government. The aim of this study was to assess impacts on air quality in São Paulo – Brazil, during the partial lockdown implemented to provide social distancing required due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have analyzed data from four air quality stations in São Paulo, Brazil to assess air pollutant concentration variations during the partial lockdown. Data were compared to the five-year monthly mean and to the four-week before the partial lockdown. Overall, drastic reductions on NO (up to −77.3%), NO
Air pollution, sociodemographic and health conditions effects on COVID-19 mortality in Colombia: an ecological study;The present study aimed to determine the association between chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM
Can roflumilast become steroid-sparing alternative in the treatment of COVID-19?;According to WHO the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic is yet to come. Despite of the exceptional measures being undertaken by regulatory agencies to expedite vaccine development, we may be several months if not years away from an effective vaccine. In such unprecedented times, the only resort nations have at their disposal is to identify and repurpose existing drugs against COVID-19 based on their known clinical or pharmacological profile which can provide direct or corroborative evidence of favorable benefit: risk in the management of COVID-19. Immune-mediated inflammation remains the hallmark of severe complications related to COVID-19 and while corticosteroids have shown preliminary evidence of benefit, they can act like a double-edged sword for majority of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, there is a need to identify ‘non-steroid’ potent and safe anti-inflammatory agents for use in therapeutic armamentarium against COVID-19. This article makes a case for one such existing drug, roflumilast, that can emerge as a steroid-sparing alternative against COVID-19.
Is Colombia an example of successful containment of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic? A critical analysis of the epidemiological data, March to July 2020;By July 25, Colombia had confirmed 240 795 cases of COVID-19 and 8269 deaths (case fatality rate of 3.4%).
Endothelial dysfunction in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Gender and age influences;Several risk factors are associated with a worse outcome for COVID-19 patients
Air pollution in Ontario, Canada during the COVID-19 State of Emergency;In March of 2020, the province of Ontario declared a State of Emergency (SOE) to reduce the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This disruption to the economy provided an opportunity to measure change in air pollution when the population spends more time at home with fewer trips. Hourly air pollution observations were obtained for fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone from the Ontario air monitoring network for 2020 and the previous five years. The analysis is focused on a five-week period during the SOE with a previous five-week period used as a control. Fine particulate matter did not show any significant reductions during the SOE. Ozone concentrations at 12 of the 32 monitors were lower than any of the previous five-years
Characteristics of COVID-19 infection in Beijing;Since the first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Beijing.

Lockdown and unlock for COVID-19 and its impact on residential mobility in India: an analysis of the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, 2020;As an upshot, the countrywide lockdown and unlock period due to the COVID-19 pandemic has been supportive of altering residential mobility trends in India.
A clinical risk score to identify patients with COVID-19 at high risk of critical care admission or death: An observational cohort study;The COVID-19 pandemic continues to escalate. There is urgent need to stratify patients. Understanding risk of deterioration will assist in admission and discharge decisions, and help selection for clinical studies to indicate where risk of therapy-related complications is justified.
Immuno-pathogenesis of nCOVID-19 and a possible host-directed therapy including anti-inflammatory and anti-viral prostaglandin (PG J;Coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, also known as 2019-nCoV especially in China) replicate and divide in host cells. During this they are partly hidden from the innate immune responses although inflammatory consequences of viral replication still occur. We propose that anti-inflammatory antiviral prostaglandins may not only restrict viral replication but also prevent inflammatory responses in the lungs and other vital organs that are known to be part of the immuno-pathogenesis of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The combination of anti-inflammatory antiviral prostaglandins with interferons may lead to the clearance of viruses inside growth-restricted infected cells. However, further experimental studies and clinical trials should be conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these possible therapies.
Can hyperimmune anti-CMV globulin substitute for convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19?;Information on treatment of COVID-19 infection in renal transplant recipients is scarce, especially in symptomatic patients and patients with recent major clinical events. This group of patients suffers from different opportunistic infections which may coexist with COVID-19. Currently available expert opinions suggest reduction of immunosuppression therapy for renal transplant recipients with symptomatic COVID-19 infection with either antiviral drugs, hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin. Inspired by our experience in treatment of CMV pneumonia and literature data on the potential benefit of convalescent plasma for treatment of different viral diseases we suggest use of the hyperimmune anti-CMV gamma globulins in addition to other available therapies. Besides the immunosuppression reduction which is supposed to be beneficial, immunoglobulins with their immunomodulatory effects and possible antiviral role, may increase a possibility for favorable outcome.
Maintaining robust HIV and tuberculosis services in the COVID-19 era: A public health dilemma in Zimbabwe;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has challenged health systems worldwide. In Zimbabwe, the COVID-19 response has seen the diversion of human capital, equipment, and other resources that were meant for the HIV and tuberculosis (TB) programmes. In a country with one of the worst HIV and TB burdens globally, the authors discuss this public health dilemma of sustained HIV and TB services in the context of a new threat – COVID-19.
COVID-19 and Italy: what next?;The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30 000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity
Prostaglandin D;A characteristic feature of COVID-19 disease is lymphopenia. Lymphopenia occurs early in the clinical course and is a predictor of disease severity and outcomes. The mechanism of lymphopenia in COVID-19 is uncertain. It has been variously attributed to the release of inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-α
Coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy;This study aimed to compare clinical courses and outcomes between pregnant and reproductive-aged non-pregnant women with COVID-19, and to assess the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 in pregnancy.
Mesenchymal stem cell (MSc) secretome: A possible therapeutic strategy for intensive-care COVID-19 patients;As an emerging global health challenge, COVID-19 requires international knowledge to reach novel possible therapeutic strategies, especially for intensive-care patients. During the early stages of infection, pneumocytes II are the primary infected cells, harming the respiratory system. We have previous evidence in murine models that MSc’s secretome can be used to treat pulmonary injuries induced with bleomycin, due to its content: growth factors, extracellular vesicles, and exosomes. We hypothesize and strongly recommend MSc secretome testing and production, in 
Identifying novel factors associated with COVID-19 transmission and fatality using the machine learning approach;The COVID-19 virus has infected more than 38 million people and resulted in more than one million deaths worldwide as of October 14, 2020. By using the logistic regression model, we identified novel critical factors associated with COVID19 cases, death, and case fatality rates in 154 countries and in the 50 U.S. states. Among numerous factors associated with COVID-19 risk, economic inequality enhanced the risk of COVID-19 transmission. The per capita hospital beds correlated negatively with COVID-19 deaths. Blood types B and AB were protective factors for COVID-19 risk, while blood type A was a risk factor. The prevalence of HIV and influenza and pneumonia was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. Increased intake of vegetables, edible oil, protein, vitamin D, and vitamin K was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk, while increased intake of alcohol was associated with increased COVID-19 risk. Other factors included age, sex, temperature, humidity, social distancing, smoking, health investment, urbanization level, and race. High temperature is a more compelling factor mitigating COVID-19 transmission than low temperature. Our comprehensive identification of the factors affecting COVID-19 transmission and fatality may provide new insights into the COVID-19 pandemic and advise effective strategies for preventing and migrating COVID-19 spread.
Delay-adjusted age- and sex-specific case fatality rates for COVID-19 in South Korea: Evolution in the estimated risk of mortality throughout the epidemic;The aim of this study was to estimate delay-adjusted case fatality rates (CFRs) for COVID-19 in South Korea, and evaluate how these estimates have evolved over time throughout the epidemic.
The potential use of ABO blood group system for risk stratification of COVID-19;ABO blood groups is a cheap and affordable test that can be immediately retrieved from COVID-19 patients at the diagnosis. There is increasing evidence that non-O blood groups have both higher susceptibility and higher severity of COVID-19 infections. The reason behind such relationship seems elusive. Regarding susceptibility, Non-O individuals have Anti-A antibodies which can prevent viral entry across ACE-2 receptors, moreover, Non-O individuals are at higher risk of autoimmunity, hypercoagulable state, and dysbiosis resulting in an augmented tendency for vascular inflammatory sequelae of COVID-19. We can conclude, on the diagnostic level, that ABO blood groups can be potentially used for risk stratification of affected COVID-19 patients, to anticipate the deterioration of patients at higher risk for complications. On a therapeutic level, plasma from normal O blood group individuals might potentially replace the use of convalescent serum for the treatment of COVID-19.
Influenza versus COVID-19 cases among influenza-like illness patients in travelers from Wuhan to Hong Kong in January 2020;The COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei, China, followed the seasonal influenza epidemic. Since some COVID-19 cases may have been misdiagnosed as seasonal influenza in January 2020, before testing capacity was adequate, it is relevant to study the proportions of influenza and COVID-19 cases among influenza-like-illness (ILI) patients and their temporal pattern.
Hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients: An hypothesis;The current SARS-Cov-2 virus pandemic challenges critical care physicians and other caregivers to find effective treatment for desperately ill patients — especially those with sudden and extreme hypoxemia. Unlike patients with other forms of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, these patients do not exhibit increased lung stiffness or dramatic dyspnea., even in the presence of arterial blood oxygen levels lower than that seen normally in mixed venous blood. Urgent intubation and mechanical ventilation with high inflation pressures and raised inhaled oxygen concentration have proved unhelpful or worse, but why? Our Hypothesis is that sudden opening of a previously undetected probe-patent foramen ovale (PPFO) may explain this mystery. As hypoxemia without acidosis is a rather weak stimulus of dyspnea or increased ventilation, and opening of such an intracardiac shunt would not worsen lung mechanical properties, the absence of dramatic symptom changes would not be surprising. We point out the high frequency of PFO both in life and at autopsy, and the physiological evidence of large shunt fractions found in Covid-19 patients. Published evidence of hypercoagulability and abundant evidence of pulmonary emboli found at autopsy are in accord with our hypothesis, as they would contribute to raised pressure in the pulmonary arteries and right heart chambers, potentially causing a shunt to open. We review the interaction between viral corona spike protein and ACE-2 receptors present on the surface of alveolar lining cells, and contribution to hypercoagulabilty caused by the spike protein. Search for an open PFO after a large drop in arterial oxygen saturation can be performed at the bedside with a variety of well-established techniques including bedside echocardiography, nitrogen washout test, and imaging studies. Potential treatments might include balloon or patch closure of the shunt, and various drug treatments to lower pulmonary vascular resistance.
Mendelian randomization analysis identified genes pleiotropically associated with the risk and prognosis of COVID-19;: COVID-19 has caused a large global pandemic. Patients with COVID-19 exhibited considerable variation in disease behavior. Pervious genome-wide association studies have identified potential genetic variants involved in the risk and prognosis of COVID-19, but the underlying biological interpretation remains largely unclear.
Clinical analysis of ten pregnant women with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A retrospective study;COVID-19 is spreading globally. This study aims to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women confirmed with COVID-19 to provide reference for clinical work.
Associations of clinical characteristics and treatment regimens with the duration of viral RNA shedding in patients with COVID-19;The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic, but the factors influencing viral RNA shedding, which would help inform optimal control strategies, remain unclear.
Effectiveness of the measures to flatten the epidemic curve of COVID-19. The case of Spain;After the cases of COVID-19 skyrocketed, showing that it was no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, the governments of many countries launched mitigation strategies, trying to slow the spread of the epidemic and flatten its curve. The Spanish Government adopted physical distancing measures on March 14
Real-time estimation and prediction of mortality caused by COVID-19 with patient information based algorithm;The global COVID-19 outbreak is worrisome both for its high rate of spread, and the high case fatality rate reported by early studies and now in Italy. We report a new methodology, the Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA), for estimating the death rate of a disease in real-time using publicly available data collected during an outbreak. PIBA estimated the death rate based on data of the patients in Wuhan and then in other cities throughout China. The estimated days from hospital admission to death was 13 (standard deviation (SD), 6 days). The death rates based on PIBA were used to predict the daily numbers of deaths since the week of February 25, 2020, in China overall, Hubei province, Wuhan city, and the rest of the country except Hubei province. The death rate of COVID-19 ranges from 0.75% to 3% and may decrease in the future. The results showed that the real death numbers had fallen into the predicted ranges. In addition, using the preliminary data from China, the PIBA method was successfully used to estimate the death rate and predict the death numbers of the Korean population. In conclusion, PIBA can be used to efficiently estimate the death rate of a new infectious disease in real-time and to predict future deaths. The spread of 2019-nCoV and its case fatality rate may vary in regions with different climates and temperatures from Hubei and Wuhan. PIBA model can be built based on known information of early patients in different countries.
Immunogenicity and safety of a recombinant adenovirus type-5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine in healthy adults aged 18 years or older: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial;This is the first randomised controlled trial for assessment of the immunogenicity and safety of a candidate non-replicating adenovirus type-5 (Ad5)-vectored COVID-19 vaccine, aiming to determine an appropriate dose of the candidate vaccine for an efficacy study.
Meteorological factors and COVID-19 incidence in 190 countries: An observational study;Novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which first emerged in December 2019, has become a pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the associations between meteorological factors and COVID-19 incidence and mortality worldwide. This study included 1,908,197 confirmed cases of and 119,257 deaths from COVID-19 from 190 countries between 23 January and 13 April, 2020. We used a distributed lag non-linear model with city-/country-level random intercept to investigate the associations between COVID19 incidence and daily temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. A series of confounders were considered in the analysis including demographics, socioeconomics, geographic locations, and political strategies. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the associations. The COVID-19 incidence showed a stronger association with temperature than with relative humidity or wind speed. An inverse association was identified between the COVID-19 incidence and temperature. The corresponding 14-day cumulative relative risk was 1.28 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.20–1.36] at 5 °C, and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.65–0.86) at 22 °C with reference to the risk at 11 °C. An inverse J-shaped association was observed between relative humidity and the COVID-19 incidence, with the highest risk at 72%. A higher wind speed was associated with a generally lower incidence of COVID-19, although the associations were weak. Sensitivity analyses generally yielded similar results. The COVID-19 incidence decreased with the increase of temperature. Our study suggests that the spread of COVID-19 may slow during summer but may increase during winter.
Systematically comparing COVID-19 with 2009 influenza pandemic for hospitalized patients;This study aims to comprehensively compare the clinical features of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hospitalized 2009 influenza pandemic patients.
Clinical progression of patients with COVID-19 in Shanghai, China;Studies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have generally been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial clinical characteristics. We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19.
A score combining early detection of cytokines accurately predicts COVID-19 severity and intensive care unit transfer;We aimed to explore cytokine profile in patients as it relates to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, and to establish a predictive cytokine score to discriminate severe from non-severe cases and provide a prognosis parameter for patients that will require intensive care unit (ICU) transfer.
COVID-19: A double threat to takotsubo cardiomyopathy and spontaneous coronary artery dissection?;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic that has affected millions of individuals worldwide. Prior studies suggest that COVID-19 may be associated with an increased risk for various cardiovascular disorders, such as myocardial injury, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome, and venous thromboembolism. Early reports of non-COVID-19 patients have described the concurrence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) and spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD). However, the interplay between COVID-19, TTC and SCAD has not been well established. We herein propose two sets of two-hit hypotheses for the development of SCAD and TTC in the context of COVID-19. The first two-hit hypothesis explains the development of SCAD, in which TTC-associated formation of vulnerable coronary substrate serves as the first hit (predisposing factor), and COVID-19-associated inflammation and vascular disruption serves as the second hit (precipitating factor). Conversely, another two-hit hypothesis is proposed to explain the development of TTC, in which SCAD-associated formation of vulnerable myocardial substrate serves as the first hit, and COVID-19-associated sympathetic overactivity serves as the second hit. Under this conceptual framework, COVID-19 poses a double threat for the development of SCAD (among patients with underlying TTC) as well as TTC (among patients with underlying SCAD), thereby forming a reciprocal causation. This hypothesis provides a rationale for the joint assessment of TTC and SCAD in COVID-19 patients with pertinent cardiovascular manifestations.
Therapeutic plasma exchange in adults with severe COVID-19 infection;To evaluate the therapeutic use of plasma exchange in COVID-19 patients compared to controls.
Clinical characteristics of 25 death cases with COVID-19: A retrospective review of medical records in a single medical center, Wuhan, China;This study aims to summarize the clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID-19 and to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality.
The effects of allium sativum on immunity within the scope of COVID-19 infection;The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infection is quite variable and the manifestations varies from asymptomatic disease to severe acute respiratory infection. Fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, loss of appetite, olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are the most prevalent general symptoms. Decreased immune system cells such as suppressed regulatory T cells, cytotoxic and helper T cells, natural killer cells, monocytes/macrophages and increased proinflammatory cytokines are the characteristic features. Compounds derived from Allium sativum (garlic) have the potential to decrease the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and to reverse the immunological abnormalities to more acceptable levels. Allium sativum is suggested as a beneficial preventive measure before being infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 virus.
Lymphopenia is associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections: A systemic review and meta-analysis;Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new respiratory and systemic disease which needs quick identification of potential critical patients. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the relationship between lymphocyte count and the severity of COVID-19.
Effect of a wet market on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission dynamics in China, 2019–2020;The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) originating from Wuhan spread rapidly throughout China. While its origin remains uncertain, accumulating evidence links a wet market with the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to be investigated.
Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as an independent risk factor for mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19;Several studies have described the clinical characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19), indicating severe patients tended to have higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Whether baseline NLR could be an independent predictor of in-hospital death in Chinese COVID-19 patients remains to be investigated.
COVID-19, myocardial edema and dexamethasone;Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2(SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease- 2019 (COVID-19) after emerging in china in late 2019 is spreading rapidly across the world.
The dark cloud with a silver lining: Assessing the impact of the SARS COVID-19 pandemic on the global environment;The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 has caused tremendous suffering and huge economic losses. We hypothesized that extreme measures of partial-to-total shutdown might have influenced the quality of the global environment because of decreased emissions of atmospheric pollutants. We tested this hypothesis using satellite imagery, climatic datasets (temperature, and absolute humidity), and COVID-19 cases available in the public domain. While the majority of the cases were recorded from Western countries, where mortality rates were strongly positively correlated with age, the number of cases in tropical regions was relatively lower than European and North American regions, possibly attributed to faster human-to-human transmission. There was a substantial reduction in the level of nitrogen dioxide (NO
Estimation of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone-System (RAAS)-Inhibitor effect on COVID-19 outcome: A Meta-analysis;Some studies of hospitalized patients suggested that the risk of death and/or severe illness due to COVID-19 is not associated with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin II receptor type 1 blockers (ARBs). Nevertheless, some controversy still exists and there is limited information of the ACEIs/ARBs effect size on COVID-19 prognosis.
Nasal lavage containing Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 agonist can prevent and reduce viral load in COVID-19;COVID-19 has been the talk of the year 2020, taking many lives and leaving others in critical conditions. It has clearly and severally been reported that the SARSCoV-2 uses the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 receptors to penetrate and infect cells. Reports have also stated that the nasal and olfactory mucosa are overloaded with these receptors. We emphasize that anosmia in COVID-19 is secondary to the binding of the SARSCoV-2 to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 receptors on the olfactory mucosa. A hypotheses pertaining to the presentation, diagnosis, management and possible prevention of SARS-CoV-2 is proposed. Given the high false negative rates of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, we suggest that COVID-19 negative patients with anosmia without any other nasal symptom should raise a high index of suspicion and should be further evaluated.
Lopinavir–ritonavir in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial;Lopinavir–ritonavir has been proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 on the basis of in vitro activity, preclinical studies, and observational studies. Here, we report the results of a randomised trial to assess whether lopinavir–ritonavir improves outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.
Periodontal pocket and COVID-19: Could there be a possible link?;COVID-19 is the emerging health emergency ruining the well being of individuals and devastating the global economies. Sustained research focusing on the virus has been on throughout the world. However, no definitive remedies have yet been derived in the containment of the virus. Steady knowledge on the pathogenesis of the virus has revealed certain consistent features specific to the disease which includes massive destruction of the lung due to the presence of excessive angiotensin-converting enzyme receptors (ACE2) which are essential for the viral entry inside the host. Once, access is gained multiplication occurs resulting in suppressing the immune response of the body against the virus. Henceforth, the equilibrium of the host is disrupted leading to manifestation of the disease. The Periodontal pocket also presents with pathology very much similar to COVID-19 and a possibility of dual role can be thought of pertaining to aspects of Periodontal Medicine.
The role of testing in the fight against COVID-19: Current happenings in Africa and the way forward;The dramatic increase in suspected COVID-19 cases in Africa has placed an enormous burden on public and private clinical facilities. To date, the most commonly used method for identifying and confirming the virus is the laboratory-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Unfortunately, testing capacities have been limited in many parts of Africa because of inadequate test kits, which have restricted scaling up beyond the few public health laboratories at designated locations. In this mini-review, we present Africa's preparedness and readiness for testing, why testing is crucial, the need to immediately strengthen existing facilities, and what it involves as part of combined approaches for managing the COVID-19 crisis. The review highlights the urgent need for speedy expansion and distribution of several laboratory testing platforms, including real-time PCR and serological assays to both public health facilities and fully accredited private clinical laboratories.
Should the convergence between the social and biological vulnerabilities of black communities and the COVID-19 pandemic be considered?;The context of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the structural inequalities and vulnerabilities experienced by black communities in the world, and in Brazil it is no different. The data generated in Brazil demonstrate that Brazilian inequality is alarming. Underreporting, non-prioritization of data that consider the variable race and color, and social groups in social vulnerability, help the unequal instrumentalization of epidemiological surveillance
Short-term effects of specific humidity and temperature on COVID-19 morbidity in select US cities;Little is known about the environmental conditions that drive the spatiotemporal patterns of SARS-CoV-2. Preliminary research suggests an association with meteorological parameters. However, the relationship with temperature and humidity is not yet apparent for COVID-19 cases in US cities first impacted. The objective of this study is to evaluate the association between COVID-19 cases and meteorological parameters in select US cities. A case-crossover design with a distributed lag nonlinear model was used to evaluate the contribution of ambient temperature and specific humidity on COVID-19 cases in select US cities. The case-crossover examines each COVID case as its own control at different time periods (before and after transmission occurred). We modeled the effect of temperature and humidity on COVID-19 transmission using a lag period of 7 days. A subset of 8 cities were evaluated for the relationship with meteorological parameters and 5 cities were evaluated in detail. Short-term exposure to humidity was positively associated with COVID-19 transmission in 4 cities. The associations were small with 3 out of 4 cities exhibiting higher COVID19 transmission with specific humidity that ranged from 6 to 9 g/kg. Our results suggest that weather should be considered in infectious disease modeling efforts. Future work is needed over a longer time period and across different locations to clearly establish the weather-COVID19 relationship.
A comparison of mortality-related risk factors of COVID-19, SARS, and MERS: A systematic review and meta-analysis;Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic. This systematic review compares mortality risk factors including clinical, demographic and laboratory features of COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The aim is to provide new strategies for COVID-19 prevention and treatment.
Changes in air quality during the lockdown in Barcelona (Spain) one month into the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic;Lockdown measures came into force in Spain from March 14th, two weeks after the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, to reduce the epidemic curve. Our study aims to describe changes in air pollution levels during the lockdown measures in the city of Barcelona (NE Spain), by studying the time evolution of atmospheric pollutants recorded at the urban background and traffic air quality monitoring stations. After two weeks of lockdown, urban air pollution markedly decreased but with substantial differences among pollutants. The most significant reduction was estimated for BC and NO2 (−45 to −51%), pollutants mainly related to traffic emissions. A lower reduction was observed for PM10 (−28 to −31.0%). By contrast, O
Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to prioritize hospital admission of patients affected by COVID-19 in low-resource settings with hospital-bed shortage;To use Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to determine weights for eleven criteria in order to prioritize COVID-19 non-critical patients for admission to hospital in healthcare settings with limited resources.
The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence is the key factor for deconfinement in France;A new virus, SARS-CoV-2, has spread world-wide since December 2019, probably affecting millions of people and killing thousands. Failure to anticipate the spread of the virus now seriously threatens many health systems. We have designed a model for predicting the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France, which is based on seroprevalence and makes it possible to anticipate the deconfinement strategy.
A meta-analysis of the incidence of venous thromboembolic events and impact of anticoagulation on mortality in patients with COVID-19;The incidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in patients with COVID-19 is generally high but varies markedly. However, the relationship between anticoagulation and mortality in patients with COVID-19 is still unclear.
Vitamin D3 and K2 and their potential contribution to reducing the COVID-19 mortality rate;The world is desperately seeking for a sustainable solution to combat the coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Recent research indicated that optimizing Vitamin D blood levels could offer a solution approach that promises a heavily reduced fatality rate as well as solving the public health problem of counteracting the general vitamin D deficiency. This paper dived into the immunoregulatory effects of supplementing Vitamin D
Repurposing prolactin as a promising immunomodulator for the treatment of COVID-19: Are common Antiemetics the wonder drug to fight coronavirus?;Prolactin (PRL), the well-known lactogenic hormone, plays a crucial role in immune function given the fact that long term hypoprolactinemia (serum prolactin level below normal) can even lead to death from opportunistic infection. High blood PRL level is known to provide an immunological advantage in many pathological conditions (with some exceptions like autoimmune diseases) and women, because of their higher blood PRL level, get an advantage in this regard. It has been reported that by controlled enhancement of blood PRL level (within the physiological limit and in some cases a little elevated above the normal to induce mild hyperprolactinemia) using dopamine antagonists such immune-stimulatory advantage can led to survival of the patients in many critical conditions. Here it is hypothesized that through controlled augmentation of blood PRL level using dopamine antagonists like domperidone/metoclopramide, which are commonly used drugs for the treatment of nausea and vomiting, both innate and adaptive immunity can be boosted to evade or tone down COVID-19. The hypothesis is strengthened from the fact that at least seven little-understood salient observations in coronavirus patients can apparently be explained by considering the role of enhanced PRL in line with the proposed hypothesis and hence, clinical trials (both therapeutic and prophylactic) on the role of enhanced PRL on the course and outcome of coronavirus patients should be conducted accordingly.
Is there a role for insulin-like growth factor inhibition in the treatment of COVID-19-related adult respiratory distress syndrome?;Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of death associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. IGF-1 has been implicated in ARDS, yet its role in relation to COVID-19-related lung injury has not been investigated. We hypothesize that blockage of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) mitigates lung injury and decreases the risk of death in patients COVID-19-related ARDS. Patients with fibroproliferative ARDS have been shown to have increased IGF-1 and IGF-1R staining in lung tissue specimens. Rising levels of IGF-1 in bronchioalveolar fluid (BAL) and increased IGF-1 mRNA expression in lung tissues (but declining serum IGF-1 levels) have been found in late stage ARDS compared with early lung injury. Blockage of IGF-1R decreases lung tissue damage and increases survival in bleomycin-induced as well as H1N1 influenza-related lung injury in animal models. Teprotumumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the IGF-1R that was FDA-approved in 2020 for the treatment of Graves’ orbitopathy. In order to determine if teprotumumab may reduce lung injury and death related to ARDS in the setting of COVID-19, preliminary clinical data is needed. IGF-1 levels in serum and BAL fluid must be measured in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS. Histopathology from lung samples from patients with COVID-19-related ARDS must be examined for increased expression of the IGF-1R. Once these are ascertained, and if the data support IGF-1 involvement, a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2A trial of teprotumumab therapy in the setting of COVID-19-related ARDS and non-COVID-19-related ARDS designed to generate initial data on short-term efficacy, safety, dosing and administration should be performed.
Are night shift workers at an increased risk for COVID-19?;Recent data has revealed an association between coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) incidence and seasonally regulated androgen sensitivity. This potential relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and clock genes, coupled with previously reported effects of night shift work on health, leads us to hypothesize that night shift workers may be at an increased physiological risk of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).
High-resolution Chest CT Features and Clinical Characteristics of Patients Infected with COVID-19 in Jiangsu, China;A pneumonia associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recently emerged in China. It was recognized as a global health hazard.
Inflammation: A bridge between diabetes and COVID-19, and possible management with sitagliptin;Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections experience lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storms in the severe stage of the disease, leading to multi-organ damage. The exact pattern of immune system changes and their condition during the disease process is unclear. The available knowledge has indicated that the NF-kappa-B pathway, which is induced by several mediators, has a significant role in cytokine storm through the various mechanisms. Therefore, identifying the state of the immune cells and the dominant mechanisms for the production of cytokines incorporated in the cytokine storm can be a critical step in the therapeutic approach. On the other hand, some studies identified a higher risk for diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus exhibits a close association with inflammation and increases the chance of developing COVID-19. Patients with diabetes mellitus have shown to have more virus entry, impaired immunity response, less viral elimination, and dysregulated inflammatory cytokines. The parallel analysis of COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus pathogenesis has proposed that the control of the inflammation through the interfering with the critical points of major signaling pathways may provide the new therapeutic approaches. In recent years, the role of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) in chronic inflammation has been proved. Numerous immune cells express the DPP4 protein. DPP4 regulates antibody production, cytokine secretion, and immunoglobulin class switching. DPP4 inhibitors like sitagliptin reduce inflammation intensity in different states.
New loss of smell and taste: Uncommon symptoms in COVID-19 patients on Nord Franche-Comte cluster, France;New loss of smell or taste was not included as common symptoms of COVID-19 until March 2020 when the pandemic started in Western countries. We want to describe the prevalence and features of anosmia and dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients.
Pharmacotherapy for reducing saliva and droplet production in airborne procedures may help to decrease the COVID-19 transmission: A hypothesis;The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected health care service practices worldwide. Therefore, a global reaction to prepare health care systems is mandatory. Preventing the transmission of this virus during medical and dental procedures producing airborne particles and droplets, could be considered as one of the main venues in prevention of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission in health care facilities. To the best of our knowledge, no intervention has been approved for this purpose, so the major suggestion in this regard is using personal preventive equipment (PPE) and similar measures as well as other sanitizing practices. Since we do not know how long we should face this universal issue, using antecedent pharmacotherapies for reducing oral-respiratory secretions to combat this virus might play a role in this regard. Given that currently there is no definitive cure for COVID-19, so we hypothesize that, considering drug solutions to reduce saliva and droplet production may be helpful in controlling Coronavirus spread during aerosol and respiratory droplet producing procedures.
Prospective vaccination of COVID-19 using shRNA-plasmid-LDH nanoconjugate;COVID-19 is the pandemic outbreak that is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus from December, 2019. Human race do not know the curative measure of this devastating disease. In today’s era of nanotechnology, it may use its knowledge to develop molecular vaccine to combat this disease. In this article we are intended to propose a hypothesis on the development of a vaccine that is molecular in nature to work against COVID-19. The nanoconjugate may comprise with the inorganic nanoparticle layered double hydroxide intercalated with shRNA-plasmid that have a sequence targeting towards the viral genome or viral mRNA. This nanoconjugate may be used as a nasal spray to deliver the shRNA-plasmid to the target site. The nanoconjugate will have several advantages such as they are biocompatible, they forms as stable knockdown to the target cells and they are stable in the nasal mucosa.
Factors associated with the duration of viral shedding in adults with COVID-19 outside of Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study;To investigate factors associated with the duration of viral shedding in patients with COVID-19, outside of Wuhan.
Nutritional status of patients with COVID-19;Nutrients play a vital role in the defense against infectious diseases and the regulation of inflammation
Comparison of hospitalized patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and influenza A in children under 5 years;Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, considerable attention has been paid to its epidemiology and clinical characteristics in children. However, it is also crucial for clinicians to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza viruses.
The mortality and psychological burden caused by response to COVID-19 outbreak;The world is experiencing a severe COVID-19 outbreak. To control this outbreak, many governments in the world have imposed lockdown or quarantine measures. We hypothesize that these measures may cause additional mortality and morbidity in the (near) future due to delay in diagnosing diseases and other indirect effect on health (such as economic crisis).
How mobility habits influenced the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from the Italian case study;Starting from December 2019 the world has faced an unprecedented health crisis caused by the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) due to the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. Within this topic, the aim of the paper was to quantify the effect of mobility habits in the spread of the Coronavirus in Italy through a multiple linear regression model. Estimation results showed that mobility habits represent one of the variables that explains the number of COVID-19 infections jointly with the number of tests/day and some environmental variables (i.e. PM pollution and temperature). Nevertheless, a proximity variable to the first outbreak was also significant, meaning that the areas close to the outbreak had a higher risk of contagion, especially in the initial stage of infection (time-decay phenomena). Furthermore, the number of daily new cases was related to the trips performed three weeks before. This threshold of 21 days could be considered as a sort of 
Can pioglitazone be potentially useful therapeutically in treating patients with COVID-19?;The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic disease (COVID-19) that has spread globally causing more than 30,000 deaths. Despite the immense and ongoing global effort, no efficacious drugs to fight this plague have been identified and patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), for respiratory distress, are managed mostly by means of supportive care based on oxygen maintenance. Several authors have reported that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities were indeed frequent among patients with COVID-19, which suggests that these conditions are likely to aggravate and complicate the prognosis. What the aforementioned diseases have in common is a latent chronic inflammatory state that may be associated with the alteration of laboratory parameters that are typical of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. In severe COVID-19 patients laboratory markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, D-dimer, serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase are elevated in many patients
Acute cor pulmonale from saddle pulmonary embolism in a patient with previous COVID-19: should we prolong prophylactic anticoagulation?;Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is known to be associated with a heightened risk of thromboembolism. However, the risk associated with mild and moderate illness from COVID-19 is unknown, and there is no current recommendation for prophylaxis against thromboembolism in patients after hospital treatment, unless there are established thrombophilic risk factors. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman who presented with massive saddle pulmonary embolism 1 week after initial hospital discharge, which was treated successfully with thrombolysis. This case raises the question of whether extended prophylactic anticoagulation should be considered even in low-risk COVID-19 cases.
What can we learn from a COVID-19 lung biopsy?;We report the case of a patient diagnosed with severe pneumonia due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A percutaneous lung biopsy was performed under ultrasound guidance. Morphological and ultrastructural characteristics of the patient’s lungs are presented, along with details of some important changes in inflammatory biological markers, in order to help better understand the disease and provide clues to allow members of the multidisciplinary team to save more people.
The «moonlighting protein» able to explain the T;COVID-19 is a major public health issue around the world and new data about its etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2, are urgently necessary, also translating the scientific knowledge acquired on its more similar predecessors, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, the coronaviruses responsible for SARS and MERS, respectively. Like SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 exploits the ACE2 receptors to enter the host cells

We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course.
Air pollution and temperature are associated with increased COVID-19 incidence: A time series study;Although COVID-19 is known to be caused by human-to-human transmission, it remains largely unclear whether ambient air pollutants and meteorological parameters could promote its transmission.
Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine: a dose-escalation, open-label, non-randomised, first-in-human trial;A vaccine to protect against COVID-19 is urgently needed. We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain.
The spectrum of COVID-19–associated dermatologic manifestations: An international registry of 716 patients from 31 countries;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has associated cutaneous manifestations.
Association of particulate matter pollution and case fatality rate of COVID-19 in 49 Chinese cities;The COVID-19 epidemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in 3352 deaths in China as of April 12, 2020. This study aimed to investigate the associations between particulate matter (PM) concentrations and the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 in 49 Chinese cities, including the epicenter of Wuhan. We used the Global Moran's I to analyze spatial distribution and autocorrelation of CFRs, and then we used multivariate linear regression to analyze the associations between PM
Development of Integrated Microfluidic Platform Coupled with Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy for Diagnosis of COVID-19;Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has created an alarming situation across the globe. Varieties of diagnostic protocols are being developed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Many of these diagnostic protocols however, have limitations such as for example unacceptable no of false-positive and false-negative cases, particularly during the early stages of infection. At present, the real-time (quantitative) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, RT-PCR based tests are complex, expensive, time consuming and involve pre-processing of samples. A swift, sensitive, inexpensive protocol for mass screening is urgently needed to contain this pandemic. There is urgent need to harness new powerful technologies for accurate detection not only of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) but also combating the emergence of pandemics of new viruses as well. To overcome the current challenges, the authors propose a diagnostic protocol based on surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) coupled with microfluidic devices containing integrated microchannels functionalized either with vertically aligned Au/Ag coated carbon nanotubes or with disposable electrospun micro/nano-filter membranes. These devices have the potential to successfully trap viruses from diverse biological fluids/secretions including saliva, nasopharyngeal, tear etc. These can thus enrich the viral titre and enable accurate identification of the viruses from their respective Raman signatures. If the device is successfully developed and proven to detect target viruses, it would facilitate rapid screening of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic individuals of COVID-19. This would be a valuable diagnostic tool not only for mass screening of current COVID -19 pandemic but also in viral pandemic outbreaks of future.
Factors affecting perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 prevention measures among Filipinos during Enhanced Community Quarantine in Luzon, Philippines: Integrating Protection Motivation Theory and extended Theory of Planned Behavior;The current study integrated Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to evaluate factors affecting the perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 prevention measures among Filipinos during Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) in Luzon, Philippines.
Taking a lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic: Preventing the future outbreaks of viral zoonoses through a multi-faceted approach;The pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a significant burden to healthcare systems, economic crisis, and public fears. It is also a lesson to be learned and a call-to-action to minimize the risk of future viral pandemics and their associated challenges. The present paper outlines selected measures (i.e., monitoring and identification of novel viral agents in animals, limitations to wildlife trade, decreasing hunting activities, changes to mink farming and meat production), the implementation of which would decrease such a risk. The role of viral surveillance systems and research exploring the virus strains associated with different animal hosts is emphasized along with the need for stricter wild trade regulations and changes to hunting activities. Finally, the paper suggests modifications to the meat production system, particularly through the introduction of cultured meat that would not only decrease the risk of exposure to novel human viral pathogens but also strengthen food security and decrease the environmental impacts of food production.
Assessing the relationship between ground levels of ozone (O;This paper investigates the correlation between the high level of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection accelerated transmission and lethality, and surface air pollution in Milan metropolitan area, Lombardy region in Italy. For January–April 2020 period, time series of daily average inhalable gaseous pollutants ozone (O
COVID-19 in Italy: Considerations on official data;COVID-19 represents a major public health issue in Italy
Does solar ultraviolet radiation play a role in COVID-19 infection and deaths? An environmental ecological study in Italy;A significantly stronger impact in mortality and morbidity by COVID-19 has been observed in the northern Italian regions compared to the southern ones. The reasons of this geographical pattern might involve several concurrent factors. The main objective of this work is to investigate whether any correlations exist between the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the different Italian regions and the amount of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation at the Earth's surface. To this purpose, in this environmental ecological study a mixed-effect exponential regression was built to explain the incidence of COVID-19 based on the environmental conditions, and demographic and pathophysiologic factors. Observations and estimates of the cumulative solar UV exposure have been included to quantify the amount of radiation available e.g., for pre-vitamin D3 synthesis or SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by the sunlight. The analysis shows a significant correlation (
Can volcanic trace elements facilitate Covid-19 diffusion? A hypothesis stemming from the Mount Etna area, Sicily;In December 2019, severe cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology were reported in Wuhan city, in China. Lately, the pneumonia was related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the diseases was termed coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At the end of January 2020, the infection spread all over Italy, but with high infection rates and mortality in the northern part, especially in Lombardy, the most industrialized and polluted region of the country. It is noteworthy that a strong association between severe viral respiratory disease and air pollution has been described. Air pollutant could be solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases and can be of natural origin (such as ash from a volcanic eruption) or released from motor vehicle depletes (carbon monoxide gas) or factories (sulfur dioxide). Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of sulphuric acid, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrochloric acid into the atmosphere. Pulmunary diseases spread by means of small droplets in the breath, also called aerosols, and air pollution may facilitate the outside survival of viruses. We suppose that ash and gases emitted from the Mount Etna contributed to air pollution, potentially favouring the major contagion of COVID-19 in the eastern flank of the mountain, as in Catania city. In fact, ash and gases (with regard to radon) are usually particularly intense in winter, with a reduction of emission of specific metals with warmer weather. This is the first paper that elaborates the hypothesis of a potential role of volcanic gases and heavy metals-related air pollution, combined to specific climatic conditions and regional topography, in favouring severe COVID-19 diffusion in Sicily. Clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to support the hypothesis and plan the due prevention and awareness-raising campaigns.
Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study;Since Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.
Rapid asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 during the incubation period demonstrating strong infectivity in a cluster of youngsters aged 16-23 years outside Wuhan and characteristics of young patients with COVID-19: A prospective contact-tracing study;The outbreak of coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread to many places outside Wuhan. Previous studies on COVID-19 mostly included older hospitalized-adults. Little information on infectivity among and characteristics of youngsters with COVID-19 is available.
Neutralizing antibodies mediate virus-immune pathology of COVID-19;SARS-CoV-2 is a novel beta-coronavirus causing over 200.000 lethal cases within six months of first infecting humans. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, a form of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). COVID-19 is characterized by two phases: the first resembles the flu with pneumonia, but after about seven or eight days the disease suddenly worsens to a sepsis-like syndrome. It is difficult to explain this virus-immune-pathology sequence from virology or immunology only. This paper hypothesizes that host-produced anti-spike protein antibodies are responsible for immune-induced viral dissemination. Subsequently, systemic distribution of virus-antibodies complexes activates the immune pathology observed in severe COVID-19.
Meta-analysis of coagulation parameters associated with disease severity and poor prognosis of COVID-19;To determine whether abnormal coagulation parameters are associated with disease severity and poor prognosis in patients with 2019 Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19).
CORTICOSTEROIDS IN THE TREATMENT OF SEVERE COVID-19 LUNG DISEASE: THE PULMONOLOGY PERSPECTIVE FROM THE FIRST UNITED STATES EPICENTER;The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has introduced the medical community to a lung disease heretofore unknown to most clinicians. In much of the discourse about COVID-19 lung disease, the more familiar clinical entity of ARDS has been used as the guiding paradigm. Reflecting on studies in ARDS, particularly that due to influenza, and on data from the SARS-CoV and MERS epidemics, many authorities, including within the discipline of infectious diseases, were initially passionate in their opposition to the use of corticosteroids for lung involvement in COVID-19. The voice of the pulmonology community—the community of lung experts—has continued to be among the quietest in this conversation. Herein we offer our perspective as academic pulmonologists who encountered COVID-19 in its first United States epicenter of New York City. We encourage a conceptual separation between early COVID-19 lung involvement and ARDS. We draw on history with other immune cell-mediated lung diseases, on insights from the SARS-CoV experience, and on frontline observations in an attempt to allay the skepticism towards corticosteroids in COVID-19 lung disease that is likely to persist even as favorable study results emerge.
Investigation of effective climatology parameters on COVID-19 outbreak in Iran;SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) Coronavirus cases are confirmed throughout the world and millions of people are being put into quarantine. A better understanding of the effective parameters in infection spreading can bring about a logical measurement toward COVID-19. The effect of climatic factors on spreading of COVID-19 can play an important role in the new Coronavirus outbreak. In this study, the main parameters, including the number of infected people with COVID-19, population density, intra-provincial movement, and infection days to end of the study period, average temperature, average precipitation, humidity, wind speed, and average solar radiation investigated to understand how can these parameters effects on COVID-19 spreading in Iran? The Partial correlation coefficient (PCC) and Sobol’-Jansen methods are used for analyzing the effect and correlation of variables with the COVID-19 spreading rate. The result of sensitivity analysis shows that the population density, intra-provincial movement have a direct relationship with the infection outbreak. Conversely, areas with low values of wind speed, humidity, and solar radiation exposure to a high rate of infection that support the virus's survival. The provinces such as Tehran, Mazandaran, Alborz, Gilan, and Qom are more susceptible to infection because of high population density, intra-provincial movements and high humidity rate in comparison with Southern provinces.
Excess mortality due to COVID-19 in Germany;The first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany lasted from week 10 to 23 in 2020. The aim is to provide estimates of excess mortality in Germany during this time.
A possible application of hinokitiol as a natural zinc ionophore and anti-infective agent for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and viral infections;Zinc and the combination with zinc ionophore have been reported in basic research and several clinical investigations as a potentially viable and economical preventive and therapeutic options for COVID-19 treatment. Zinc is a vital microelement that actively supports respiratory epithelium barrier integrity, innate and adaptive immune functions, and inflammatory regulations. Moreover, zinc may also prevent viral entry, suppress viral replication, and mitigate the damages due to oxidative stress and hyperinflammatory reaction in patients with respiratory infections. Hinokitiol (β-thujaplicin) is a natural monoterpenoid and is considered as a safe zinc ionophore to help zinc transport into cells. It has been widely used in skin and oral care, and therapeutic products for its potent antiviral, antimicrobial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer applications.
Disinfection technology and strategies for COVID-19 hospital and bio-medical waste management;The isolation wards, institutional quarantine centers, and home quarantine are generating a huge amount of bio-medical waste (BMW) worldwide since the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The personal protective equipment, testing kits, surgical facemasks, and nitrile gloves are the major contributors to waste volume. Discharge of a new category of BMW (COVID-waste) is of great global concern to public health and environmental sustainability if handled inappropriately. It may cause exponential spreading of this fatal disease as waste acts as a vector for SARS-CoV-2, which survives up to 7 days on COVID-waste (like facemasks). Proper disposal of COVID-waste is therefore immediately requires to lower the threat of pandemic spread and for sustainable management of the environmental hazards. Henceforth, in the present article, disinfection technologies for handling COVID-waste from its separate collection to various physical and chemical treatment steps have been reviewed. Furthermore, policy briefs on the global initiatives for COVID-waste management including the applications of different disinfection techniques have also been discussed with some potential examples effectively applied to reduce both health and environmental risks. This article can be of great significance to the strategy development for preventing/controlling the pandemic of similar episodes in the future.
Critical illness myopathy after COVID-19;This paper describes a patient who developed diffuse and symmetrical muscle weakness after a long stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The patient underwent a neurophysiological protocol, including nerve conduction studies, concentric needle electromyography (EMG) of the proximal and distal muscles, and direct muscle stimulation (DMS). Nerve conduction studies showed normal sensory conduction and low-amplitude compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs). EMG revealed signs of myopathy, which were more pronounced in the lower limbs. The post-DMS CMAP was absent in the quadriceps and of reduced amplitude in the tibialis anterior muscle. Based on these clinical and neurophysiological findings, a diagnosis of critical illness myopathy was made according to the current diagnostic criteria. Given the large number of patients with COVID-19 who require long ICU stays, many are very likely to develop ICU-acquired weakness, as did the patient described here. Health systems must plan to provide adequate access to rehabilitative facilities for both pulmonary and motor rehabilitative treatment after COVID-19.
Evaluation of the lockdowns for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy and Spain after one month follow up;From the end of February, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Spain has been following the footsteps of that in Italy very closely. We have analyzed the trends of incident cases, deaths, and intensive care unit admissions (ICU) in both countries before and after their respective national lockdowns using an interrupted time-series design. Data was analyzed with quasi-Poisson regression using an interaction model to estimate the change in trends. After the first lockdown, incidence trends were considerably reduced in both countries. However, although the slopes have been flattened for all outcomes, the trends kept rising. During the second lockdown, implementing more restrictive measures for mobility, it has been a change in the trend slopes for both countries in daily incident cases and ICUs. This improvement indicates that the efforts overtaken are being successful in flattening the epidemic curve, and reinforcing the belief that we must hold on.
Positive effects of COVID-19 control measures on influenza prevention;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now become a pandemic threat to the whole world. At the same time, influenza virus has been active, with influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 sharing the same transmission routes. This article aims to alert clinicians of the presence of co-infection with these two viruses and to describe the effect of the measures taken to fight COVID-19 on influenza prevention and control.
Early administration of interleukin-6 inhibitors for patients with severe COVID-19 disease is associated with decreased intubation, reduced mortality, and increased discharge;The aim of this observational study was to determine the optimal timing of interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor (IL6ri) administration for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Azithromycin in addition to standard of care versus standard of care alone in the treatment of patients admitted to the hospital with severe COVID-19 in Brazil (COALITION II): a randomised clinical trial;The efficacy and safety of azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 remain uncertain. We assessed whether adding azithromycin to standard of care, which included hydroxychloroquine, would improve clinical outcomes of patients admitted to the hospital with severe COVID-19.
COVID-19: How to make between-country comparisons;Different countries have adopted different containment and testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2. The difference in testing makes it difficult to compare the effect of different containment strategies. This study proposes methods to allow a direct comparison and presents the results.
Management of a COVID-19 outbreak in a hotel in Tenerife, Spain;Since the first accounts of SARS-CoV-2, authorities have encountered numerous unprecedented situations threatening public health. This rapid communication addresses events that led to the quarantining of a hotel in Tenerife, Spain and the effectiveness of the rapidly implemented control measures. In total, eight cases have been associated with the hotel. Due to the international nature of the guests, had these timely precautions not been in place, a multinational cluster might have formed.
Pernio-like skin lesions associated with COVID-19: A case series of 318 patients from 8 countries;Increasing evidence suggests pernio-like lesions are cutaneous manifestations of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Wastewater surveillance for population-wide Covid-19: The present and future;The Covid-19 pandemic (Coronavirus disease 2019) continues to expose countless unanticipated problems at all levels of the world's complex, interconnected society — global domino effects involving public health and safety, accessible health care, food security, stability of economies and financial institutions, and even the viability of democracies. These problems pose immense challenges that can voraciously consume human and capital resources. Tracking the initiation, spread, and changing trends of Covid-19 at population-wide scales is one of the most daunting challenges, especially the urgent need to map the distribution and magnitude of Covid-19 in near real-time. Other than pre-exposure prophylaxis or therapeutic treatments, the most important tool is the ability to quickly identify infected individuals. The mainstay approach for epidemics has long involved the large-scale application of diagnostic testing at the individual case level. However, this approach faces overwhelming challenges in providing fast surveys of large populations.
Diacerein: A potential multi-target therapeutic drug for COVID-19;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), was declared pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 binds its host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through the viral spike (S) protein. The mortality related to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in COVID-19 patients has been suggested to be connected with cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), an excessive immune response that severely damages healthy lung tissue. In addition, cardiac symptoms, including fulminant myocarditis, are frequent in patients in a severe state of illness. Diacerein (DAR) is an anthraquinone derivative drug whose active metabolite is rhein. Different studies have shown that this compound inhibits the IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, TNF-α, NF-κB and NALP3 inflammasome pathways. The antiviral activity of rhein has also been documented. This metabolite prevents hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and influenza A virus (IAV) adsorption and replication through mechanisms involving regulation of oxidative stress and alterations of the TLR4, Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB signalling pathways. Importantly, rhein inhibits the interaction between the SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting rhein as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of SARS-CoV infection. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that DAR is a multi-target drug useful for COVID-19 treatment. This anthraquinone may control hyperinflammatory conditions by multi-faceted cytokine inhibition and by reducing viral infection.
Should an intersection between visceral leishmaniasis endemicity and the COVID-19 pandemic be considered?;The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the infection with the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, revealed individual and global vulnerabilities, in which we highlight the social, economic, and political aspects and the health systems’ organization in the countries. Brazil remains with a high transmission rate and presents a centripetal distribution as observed through a more sustained growth in the number of municipalities affected, outlining a profile of invasion of poor communities. Several vulnerabilities overlap with precarious housing conditions, lack of basic sanitation, malnutrition, and endemicity for neglected chronic diseases such as visceral leishmaniasis (VL). COVID-19 and VL evidently do not share clinical features, but exactly because of the distinct immunopathogenesis between the diseases, patients with VL may present a vulnerability in the immune system against antiviral responses. Considering that VL susceptibility seems to be related to an inefficient and polarized immune response, it is likely that in endemic areas, the overlap of social weaknesses added to individual vulnerability by immune polarization may aggravate the COVID-19 condition. In this sense, we reinforce that possible relationships between endemic neglected diseases such as VL and pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection need to be further considered and investigated.
When the fourth water and digital revolution encountered COVID-19;The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is, undeniably, a substantial shock to our civilization which has revealed the value of public services that relate to public health. Ensuring a safe and reliable water supply and maintaining water sanitation has become ever more critical during the pandemic. For this reason, researchers and practitioners have promptly investigated the impact associated with the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on water treatment processes, focusing specifically on water disinfection. However, the COVID-19 pandemic impacts multiple aspects of the urban water sector besides those related to the engineering processes, including sanitary, economic, and social consequences which can have significant effects in the near future. Furthermore, this outbreak appears at a time when the water sector was already experiencing a fourth revolution, transitioning toward the digitalisation of the sector, which redefines the Water-Human-Data Nexus. In this contribution, a product of collaboration between academics and practitioners from water utilities, we delve into the multiple impacts that the pandemic is currently causing and their possible consequences in the future. We show how the digitalisation of the water sector can provide useful approaches and tools to help address the impact of the pandemic. We expect this discussion to contribute not only to current challenges, but also to the conceptualization of new projects and the broader task of ameliorating climate change.
Diagnostic accuracy of the FebriDx host response point-of-care test in patients hospitalised with suspected COVID-19;Management of the COVID-19 pandemic is hampered by long delays associated with centralised laboratory PCR testing. In hospitals this leads to poor patient flow and nosocomial transmission and so rapid, accurate diagnostic tests are urgently required. The FebriDx is a point-of-care test that detects an antiviral host response protein in finger prick blood within 10 min, but its accuracy for the identification of COVID-19 is unknown.
Primary concentration – The critical step in implementing the wastewater based epidemiology for the COVID-19 pandemic: A mini-review;The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has posed a significant global public health threat and caused dramatic social and economic disruptions. A new research direction is attracting a significant amount of attention in the academic community of environmental sciences and engineering, in which rapid community-level monitoring could be achieved by applying the methodology of wastewater based epidemiology (WBE). Given the fact that the development of a mass balance on the total number of viral RNA copies in wastewater samples and the infected stool specimens is the heart of WBE, the result of the quantitative RNA detection in wastewater has to be highly sensitive, accurate, and reliable. Thus, applying effective concentration methods before the subsequent RNA extraction and RT-qPCR detection is a must-have procedure for the WBE. This review provides new insights into the primary concentration methods that have been adopted by the eighteen recently reported COVID-19 wastewater detection studies, along with a brief discussion of the mechanisms of the most commonly used virus concentration methods, including the PEG-based separation, electrostatically charged membrane filtration, and ultrafiltration. In the end, two easy and well-proven concentration strategies are recommended as below, aiming to maximize the practical significance and operational effectiveness of the SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration from wastewater samples.
The association between obesity and poor outcome after COVID-19 indicates a potential therapeutic role for montelukast;It is widely believed that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus triggers a disproportionate immune response which causes a devastating systemic injury, particularly in individuals with obesity, itself a chronic, multi-organ inflammatory disease. Immune cells accumulate in visceral adipose tissue and together with paracrine adipocytes release a wide range of biologically active cytokines (including IL-1β, IL5, IL6 and IL8) that can result in both local, pulmonary and systemic inflammation. A more intense ‘cytokine storm’ is postulated as the mechanism behind the extreme immune response seen in severe COVID-19.
Could a family history of type 2 diabetes be a risk factor to the endothelial damage in the patient with COVID-19?;In December 2019, in China, a disease derived from a new beta coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported, which was termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, it is known that endothelial cell dysfunction is a critical event in the infection by this virus. However, in a representative percentage of patients with COVID-19, neither cardiovascular disease nor diabetes mellitus, which could be linked with endothelial dysfunction, has been reported. Previous evidence has shown the presence of early endothelial dysfunction in healthy subjects but with a family history of type 2 diabetes (FH-DM2), where glucose metabolism, the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as expression of genes involved with their synthesis are impaired. Besides, in subjects with an FH-DM2, the presence of hyperinsulinemia and high glucose levels are common events that could favor the infection of endothelial cells by the coronavirus. Interestingly, both events have been reported in patients with COVID-19, in whom hyperinsulinemia increases the surface expression of ACE2 through a diminution of ADAMTS17 activity
Clinical and virological data of the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe: a case series;On Dec 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people at Wuhan, Hubei Province. The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020.
Electric fans: A potential stay-at-home cooling strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic this summer?;Current public health guidance designed to protect individuals against extreme heat and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is seemingly discordant, yet during the northern hemisphere summer, we are faced with the imminent threat of their simultaneous existence. Here we examine the environmental limits of electric fan-use in the context of the United States summer as a potential stay-at-home cooling strategy that aligns with existing efforts to mitigate the spread of SARS-COV-2.
Transmission onset distribution of COVID-19;The distribution of the transmission onset of COVID-19 relative to the symptom onset is a key parameter for infection control. It is often not easy to study the transmission onset time, as it is difficult to know who infected whom exactly when.
Dynamic changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in adult patients with COVID-19;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread widely. The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamic changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in adult patients with COVID-19.
A spatio-temporal analysis for exploring the effect of temperature on COVID-19 early evolution in Spain;The new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, was reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This new pathogen has spread rapidly around more than 200 countries, in which Spain has one of the world's highest mortality rates so far. Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that weather conditions may affect the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases. However, some contradictory studies have also been reported in the same research line. In addition, many of these studies have been performed considering only meteorological factors, which can limit the reliability of the results. Herein, we report a spatio-temporal analysis for exploring the effect of daily temperature (mean, minimum and maximum) on the accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in the provinces of Spain. Non-meteorological factors such as population density, population by age, number of travellers and number of companies have also been considered for the analysis. No evidence suggesting a reduction in COVID-19 cases at warmer mean, minimum and maximum temperatures has been found. Nevertheless, these results need to be interpreted cautiously given the existing uncertainty about COVID-19 data, and should not be extrapolated to temperature ranges other than those analysed here for the early evolution period.
Surfactant-based prophylaxis and therapy against COVID-19: A possibility;Hand hygiene by washing with soap and water is recommended for the prevention of COVID-19 spread. Soaps and detergents are explained to act by damaging viral spike glycoproteins (peplomers) or by washing out the virus through entrapment in the micelles. Technically, soaps come under a functional category of molecules known as surfactants. Surfactants are widely used in pharmaceutical formulations as excipients. We wonder why surfactants are still not tried for prophylaxis or therapy against COVID-19? That too when many of them have proven antiviral properties. Moreover, lung surfactants have already shown benefits in respiratory viral infections. Therefore, we postulate that surfactant-based prophylaxis and therapy would be promising. We believe that our hypothesis would stimulate debate or new research exploring the possibility of surfactant-based prophylaxis and therapy against COVID-19. The success of a surfactant-based technique would save the world from any such pandemic in the future too.
Safety and immunogenicity of an rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine in two formulations: two open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies from Russia;We developed a heterologous COVID-19 vaccine consisting of two components, a recombinant adenovirus type 26 (rAd26) vector and a recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) vector, both carrying the gene for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein (rAd26-S and rAd5-S). We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two formulations (frozen and lyophilised) of this vaccine.
Hypoxic preconditioning – a non-pharmacological approach in COVID-19 prevention;Hypoxia is defined by low oxygen concentration in organs, tissues and cells. Maintaining oxygen homeostasis represents the essential cellular metabolic process for the structural integrity of tissues in different pathological conditions, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Considering the role of hypoxia–inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) as regulator of cellular response to hypoxia and its involvement in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, glucose metabolism, inflammation, we propose hypoxic preconditiong (HPC) as a novel prevention therapeutic approach on healthy contacts of COVID-19 patients. To date, several studies revealed the benefic effects of hypoxic preconditioning in ischemia, kidney failure and in pulmonary function recovery of lung surgery patients. HPC increases the expression of factors that promote cell survival and angiogenesis, induces an anti-inflammatory outcome, triggers coordinated hypoxia responses that promote erythropoiesis, and mobilizes the circulating progenitor cells. Futhermore, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) exposed to HPC show improvement of their regenerative capacities, and increases the effectiveness of stem cell therapy in different pathologies, including COVID-19. In conclusion, HPC should be considered an approach with beneficial outcomes and without significant side effects when the organism is severely exposed to the same stressor. HPC appears as a trigger to mechanisms that improve and maintain tissue oxygenation and repair, a main goal in different pathologies, including COVID-19 or other respiratory conditions.
Plausible mechanisms of Niclosamide as an antiviral agent against COVID-19;Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused 18 440 deaths world wide as of 25 March 2020 and posing a serious threat to public health. There is a need, therefore, for effective therapeutic strategies to cure this disease. However, high attrition rates, substantial costs and slow pace are the major limitations of novel drug discovery. Drug repurposing, by employing ‘old’ drugs to treat ‘new’ diseases is an attractive approach in drug discovery. Niclosamide (NIC) is an approved anti-helminthic drug with diverse antiviral mechanisms. In this work we hypothesize, the potential antiviral mechanisms of NIC against COVID-19.
Prevalence and recovery time of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in hospitalized patients with COVID‑19 in Wuhan, China;To investigate olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan using a telephone interview.
Investigation of a COVID-19 outbreak in Germany resulting from a single travel-associated primary case: a case series;In December, 2019, the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, causing COVID-19, a respiratory disease presenting with fever, cough, and often pneumonia. WHO has set the strategic objective to interrupt spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. An outbreak in Bavaria, Germany, starting at the end of January, 2020, provided the opportunity to study transmission events, incubation period, and secondary attack rates.
Quantifying the impact of public health protection measures on the spread of SARS-CoV-2;The new virus, SARS-CoV-2, has probably affected millions of people world-wide since December 2019 and killed thousand. We have designed a model and used it to quantify the effect of local protective measures on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, assess their effectiveness and adapt health service strategies in Toulouse, France.
The temperature and regional climate effects on communitarian COVID-19 contagion in Mexico throughout phase 1;Due to the close relationship between the incidence of infectious diseases by epidemics and environmental conditions, this research explores the temperature, evaporation, precipitation and regional climate effects on the local transmission of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 inside 31 states and capital of Mexico since February 29 (national onset) to March 31, 2020. Statistical analysis was conducted to explore the association between the daily local COVID-19 confirmed positive cases (LCPC) and both climate characteristics and the daily weather reported by the regional meteorological stations. In this work, the local transmission ratio (LTR) was calculated with the regional LCPC divided by the number of the effective contagion days since regional onset in each state. The results showed a negative association between temperature (mean, max and min) and climate classification with both LCPC and LTR variables. The precipitation associated positively with LCPC and LTR. The associations between the climate classification with LCPC and LTR are statistically significant. The tropical climate (mean temperature around 25.95 °C and mean precipitation around 8.74 mm) delayed the regional onset. However, the regional onset in dry climates emerged earlier as consequence of the lower temperatures and higher precipitations (20.57 °C and 20.87 mm respectively) than the observed in the tropical climate. The fastest regional onsets were observed in tempered climates in states where the lowest temperatures and lowest precipitations were registered (19.65 °C and 8.48 mm respectively). Meteorological factors influenced the trend on the regional outbreaks in Mexican's states likely by the host predisposition and susceptibility during the cold winter season. In Mexico, the climate characteristics played a crucial role on the local infection during the phase 1 being the tempered regions (as Michoacán, Jalisco, Puebla, etc.) more vulnerable than the dry (as Chihuahua, Durango or Zacatecas, etc.) or tropical areas (as Colima, Campeche, Morelos etc.).
Adsorptive granulocyte and monocyte apheresis: A potentially relevant therapeutic option for COVID-19;The overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines and subsequent thromboembolism are major problems of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Adsorptive granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA), used for ulcerative colitis, is an extracorporeal therapy designed to remove activated myeloid lineage cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that GMA decreases proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophil–platelet aggregates. The effect of GMA on COVID-19 in a patient with ulcerative colitis was recently reported. The modes of action of GMA together with the findings of this case report indicate that GMA could be a relevant treatment option for COVID-19.
Antibody responses after COVID-19 infection in patients who are mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic in Bangladesh;Studies on serological responses following coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have been published primarily in individuals who are moderately or severely symptomatic, but there are few data from individuals who are mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic.
Phosphatidylglycerol and surfactant: A potential treatment for COVID-19?;A hypothesis concerning the potential utility of surfactant supplementation for the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is proposed, along with a brief summary of the data in the literature supporting this idea. It is thought that surfactant, which is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for intratracheal administration to treat neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in pre-term infants, could benefit COVID-19-infected individuals by: (1) restoring surfactant damaged by lung infection and/or decreased due to the virus-induced death of the type II pneumocytes that produce it and (2) reducing surface tension to decrease the work of breathing and limit pulmonary edema. In addition, a constituent of surfactant, phosphatidylglycerol, could mitigate COVID-19-induced lung pathology by: (3) decreasing excessive innate immune system stimulation via its inhibition of toll-like receptor-2 and -4 activation by microbial components and cellular proteins released by damaged cells, thereby limiting inflammation and the resultant pulmonary edema, and (4) possibly blocking spread of the viral infection to non-infected cells in the lung. Therefore, it is suggested that surfactant preparations containing phosphatidylglycerol be tested for their ability to improve lung function in critically ill patients with COVID-19.
National Psoriasis Foundation COVID-19 Task Force Guidance for Management of Psoriatic Disease During the Pandemic: Version 1;To provide guidance about management of psoriatic disease during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
Risk-adapted Treatment Strategy For COVID-19 Patients;There are no clear expert consensus or guidelines on how to treat 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The objective of this study is to investigate the short-term effect of risk-adapted treatment strategy on patients with COVID-19.
Wastewater surveillance for Covid-19: An African perspective;The COVID-19 pandemic has once again highlighted the importance of access to sufficient quantities of safe water and sanitation in public health. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, an early warning wastewater system has been proposed as a platform for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, and a potentially important public health strategy to combat the disease. This short communication on wastewater surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa highlights challenges, opportunities and alternatives taken into account the local context.
Potential role of zinc supplementation in prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19;Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents the largest current health challenge for the society. At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with this disease are only supportive. It is well known that zinc (Zn) possesses a variety of direct and indirect antiviral properties, which are realized through different mechanisms. Administration of Zn supplement has a potential to enhance antiviral immunity, both innate and humoral, and to restore depleted immune cell function or to improve normal immune cell function, in particular in immunocompromised or elderly patients. Zn may also act in a synergistic manner when co-administered with the standard antiviral therapy, as was demonstrated in patients with hepatitis C, HIV, and SARS-CoV-1. Effectiveness of Zn against a number of viral species is mainly realized through the physical processes, such as virus attachment, infection, and uncoating. Zn may also protect or stabilize the cell membrane which could contribute to blocking of the virus entry into the cell. On the other hand, it was demonstrated that Zn may inhibit viral replication by alteration of the proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in rhinoviruses, HCV, and influenza virus, and diminish the RNA-synthesizing activity of nidoviruses, for which SARS-CoV-2 belongs. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that Zn supplementation may be of potential benefit for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19.
What do we know about the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in the environment?;In view of the current situation regarding the Covid-19 disease, a discussion is proposed on the need for research focusing on the presence and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in water, soils and other environmental compartments, reached through wastewater and sewage sludge spreading. Also, the evaluation of current treatments for wastewater and sewage sludge, as well as the eventual development of new specific techniques, based on sorption, nanotechnology, etc., would be of great interest for controlling the environmental dissemination of these viruses in the current and eventual future outbreaks.
Amantadine as a drug to mitigate the effects of COVID-19;The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the world. At this time, there is no vaccine that can help people prevent the spread of coronavirus.
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic lockdown: Effects on air quality in the industrialized Gujarat state of India;Two weeks after the world health organization described the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak as pandemic, the Indian government implemented lockdown of industrial activities and traffic flows across the entire nation between March 24 and May 31, 2020. In this paper, we estimated the improvements achieved in air quality during the lockdown period (March 24, 2020 and April 20, 2020) compared to the pre-lockdown (January 1, 2020 and March 23, 2020) by analyzing PM
Pathways to COVID-19 ‘community protection’;To date, no country has reached a natural COVID-19 epidemic peak and observed peaks essentially reflect the effectiveness of ‘lockdown’ measures. The major challenge is finding a responsible way out of ‘lockdown’, given that SARS- CoV-2 is now an established global pathogen. Acknowledging limitations in our knowledge regarding the sufficiency and durability of immune responses following natural SARS Cov-2 infection, we discuss three pathways to ‘community protection’. Uncontrolled epidemic spread (route 1
COVID-19 faecal-oral transmission: Are we asking the right questions?;Detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in stools and sewage has recently been reported, raising the hypothesis of faecal-oral transmission. If confirmed, this could have far-reaching consequences for public health and for pandemic control strategies. In this paper, we argue that a comprehensive and more nuanced analysis is required to test this hypothesis, taking into consideration both environmental dynamics and the persistence of viral infectivity. First, we examine the evidence regarding the presence of the virus in stools and sewage. Then we discuss the current framework of disease transmission through water and excreta and how the transmission of a respiratory disease fits into it. Against this background, we propose a framework to test the faecal-oral hypothesis, unpacking the different environmental routes from faeces to the mouth of a susceptible person. This framework should not be seen as a confirmation of the hypothesis but rather as an expanded view of its complexities, which could help shaping an agenda for research into a number of unanswered questions. Finally, the paper briefly discusses practical implications, based on current knowledge, for containment of the pandemic.
Fabry disease patients have an increased risk of stroke in the COVID-19 ERA. A hypothesis;Stroke is a severe and frequent complication of Fabry disease (FD), affecting both males and females. Cerebrovascular complications are the end result of multiple and complex pathophysiology mechanisms involving endothelial dysfunction and activation, development of chronic inflammatory cascades leading to a prothrombotic state in addition to cardioembolic stroke due to cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. The recent coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak share many overlapping deleterious pathogenic mechanisms with those of FD and therefore we analyze the available information regarding the pathophysiology mechanisms of both disorders and hypothesize that there is a markedly increased risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular complications in Fabry patients suffering from concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Pro resolving inflammatory effects of the lipid mediators of omega 3 fatty acids and its implication in SARS COVID-19;COVID-19 is a new disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It was first described in 2019, developed into an epidemic in January 2020 and has spread the global to the present COVID-19 pandemic. Specialized pro‑resolving mediators (SPMs) may play a new role in the management of this lung disease because SPM actively stimulate the resolution of infectious inflammation and are organ protective in animal disease models. Many tissues have been suitable targets for treating inflammation with SPMs or their active precursors 18-HEPE, 17-HDHA and the 14-HDHA, in order to elicit dynamic resolution of inflammation.
Advanced drug delivery systems can assist in targeting coronavirus disease (COVID-19): A hypothesis;The highly contagious coronavirus, which had already affected more than 2 million people in 210 countries, triggered a colossal economic crisis consequently resulting from measures adopted by various goverments to limit transmission. This has placed the lives of many people infected worldwide at great risk. Currently there are no established or validated treatments for COVID-19, that is approved worldwide. Nanocarriers may offer a wide range of applications that could be developed into risk-free approaches for successful therapeutic strategies that may lead to immunisation against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) which is the primary causative organism that had led to the current COVID-19 pandemic. We address existing as well as emerging therapeutic and prophylactic approaches that may enable us to effectively combat this pandemic, and also may help to identify the key areas where nano-scientists can step in.
Safe hospital preparedness in the era of COVID-19: The Swiss cheese model;Since it first emerged in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly worldwide. During the pandemic of an emerging infectious disease, it is very important to prevent nosocomial outbreaks and operate hospitals safely to maintain their functions. In this article, we present the strategies for safe hospital operations based on the experiences of the Republic of Korea early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Each hospital should maintain multiple layers of defenses to prevent even small cracks in the hospital’s quarantine system.
Nocturnal oxygen therapy as an option for early COVID-19;There is currently no effective antiviral therapy or immune-based treatment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The urgent challenge is to prevent the transition of COVID-19 from mild to severe infection. This paper discussed nocturnal oxygen therapy as a new option for people with COVID-19 under home quarantine. It suggested that nocturnal oxygen therapy in the early stages may be helpful in preventing disease progression by inhibiting the rapid replication of the virus and improving the body's antiviral ability.
COVID-19: NAD;The SARS-CoV-2 hyperinflammatory response is associated with high mortality. This hypothesis suggests that a deficiency of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD
Low Incidence and Mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in Southern Europe. Proposal of a hypothesis for Arthropod borne Herd immunity;SARS-CoV-2 incidence and mortality in Europe have shown wide variation. Northern Italy in particular the Lombardy region, north-eastern French regions, Switzerland and Belgium were amongst the hardest hit, while the central and southern Italian regions, all the Balkan countries from Slovenia to Greece and the Islands of Malta and Cyprus had much fewer cases and deaths per capita, and deaths per number of cases. Differences in public health measures, and health care delivery, in the author’s opinion, can only partly explain the difference. The geographical distribution of Phlebotomus sand-flies and the relative distribution of arthropod borne diseases Leishmaniasis and Phlebovirus infections especially the Sicilian Sandfly fever group corresponds to most areas of low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. A hypothesis is proposed whereby repeated arthropod or sandfly vector infection of humans by novel viruses of zoonotic origins carrying bat or mammalian RNA/DNA, such as phleboviruses may have resulted in the development of an effective evolutionary immune response to most novel zoonotic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 by means of survival of the fittest possibly over many generations. This process probably ran in parallel and concurrent with the progressive evolution of novel coronaviruses which spread from one mammalian species to another. Other possible, but less likely mechanisms for the role of sandfly meals within a much shorter time frame may have led to, (i) previous exposure and infection of humans with the SARS-Cov-2 virus itself, or a closely related corona virus in the previous decades, or (ii) exposure of human populations to parts coronavirus protein namely either S or more likely N protein carried mechanically by arthropods, but without clinical disease causing direct immunity or (iii) by causing infection with other arthropod borne viruses which could carry bat DNA/RNA and have similar functional proteins resulting in an immediate cross-reactive immune response rather than by natural selection. The Evidence possibly supporting or disputing this hypothesis is reviewed, however the major problem with the hypothesis is that to date no coronavirus has ever been isolated from arthropods. Such a hypothesis can only be supported by research investigating the possible biological relationship of arthropods and coronaviruses where paradoxically they may be promoting immunity rather than disease.
Clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 family clusters in Beijing, China;Since its discovery, SARS-CoV-2 has been spread throughout China before becoming a global pandemic. In Beijing, family clusters are the main mode of human-human transmission accounting for 57.6% of the total confirmed cases.
SARS-CoV-2 and the sympathetic immune response: Dampening inflammation with antihypertensive drugs (Clonidine and Propranolol);Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now a pandemic with the United States now carrying the highest number of cases and fatalities. Although vaccines and antiviral agents are the main focus of therapy, here we present a plausible hypothesis to leverage our understanding of neuroimmunomodulation to intervene in the pathophysiology of the disease to prevent death.
Patients of COVID-19 may benefit from sustained Lopinavir-combined regimen and the increase of Eosinophil may predict the outcome of COVID-19 progression;To explore the epidemiological information, clinical characteristics, therapeutic outcomes and temporal progression of laboratory findings in 2019-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients exposed to lopinavir.
Preliminary estimation of the basic reproduction number of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China, from 2019 to 2020: A data-driven analysis in the early phase of the outbreak;An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit a major city in China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other provinces/regions of China and other countries. We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, 
Could aquaporin modulators be employed as prospective drugs for COVID-19 related pulmonary comorbidity?;COVID-19 initially an epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has turned out to be a life- threatening global pandemic with increased morbidity and mortality. The presence of cytokine storm has been linked with the pathogenesis of severe lung injury as evinced in COVID-19. Aquaporins (AQPs) are molecular water channels, facilitating water transport across the cell membrane in response to osmotic gradients. Impairment in alveolar fluid clearance due to altered functional expression of respiratory AQPs highlight their pathophysiological significance in pulmonary edema associated respiratory illness. Therefore, we hypothesize that targeted modulation of AQPs in lungs in the intervening period of time, could diminish the dreadful effects of inflammation- induced comorbidity in COVID-19.
COVID-19’s toll on the elderly and those with diabetes mellitus – Is vitamin B12 deficiency an accomplice?;COVID-19 exacts a disproportionate toll on both the elderly and those with diabetes
B-cell engineering: A promising approach towards vaccine development for COVID-19;With the number of cases crossing six million (and more than three hundred and seventy thousand deaths) worldwide, there is a dire need of a vaccine (and repurposing of drugs) for SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19). It can be argued that a vaccine may be the most efficient way to contain the spread of this disease and prevent its future onset. While many attempts are being made to design and develop a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, pertinent technological hitches do exist. That is perhaps one of the reasons that we don’t have vaccine for coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-1 and MERS). Recently developed CRISPR-mediated genome editing approach can be repurposed into a cell-modification endeavor in addition to (and rather than) correcting defective parts of genome. With this premise, B-cells can be engineered into universal donor, antigen specific, perpetually viable, long lasting, non-oncogenic, relatively benign, antibody producing cells which may serve as an effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 and, by the same rationale, other viruses and pathogens.
Air pollution exposure and COVID-19: A look at mortality in Mexico City using individual-level data;We use individual-level data to estimate the effects of long- and short-term exposure to air pollution (PM
‘The Double-Edged Sword’ – An hypothesis for Covid-19-induced salivary biomarkers;Utilising biomarkers for COVID-19 diagnosis, prediction of treatment response and overall prognostication have been investigated recently. However, these ventures have only considered the use of blood-based molecular markers. Saliva is another biofluid that warrants being applied in similar fashion with major advantages that centres on its non-invasive and repeatable collection as well as cost-efficiency. To this end, this article presents a hypothesis for the sources of biomarkers useful clinically for COVID-19 disease outcome estimation and identify the likely implications of their detection in saliva.
Asymptomatic patients as a source of COVID-19 infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis;Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by an unpredictable disease course, ranging from asymptomatic to severe, life-threatening infections. Asymptomatic COVID-19 infections have been described, and the aim of this systematic review was to summarise their presentation forms.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19): From causes to preventions in Hong Kong;Hong Kong has been recently attacked by the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). In late January 2020, it's shown a steadily increasing trend of confirmed cases. There is a 257 in total infected cases confirmed including 4 deaths until 20th of March 2020. To prevent further outbreak of COVID-19, this article discusses the current understanding of COVID-19 and compares with the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in 2003 of Hong Kong from the causes, transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, treatments and preventions to study for an applicable measurement to control COVID-19.
Ribosomal proteins as a possible tool for blocking SARS-COV 2 virus replication for a potential prospective treatment;Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and has resulted in more than four million cases globally and the death cases exceeded 300,000. Normally, a range of surviving and propagating host factors must be employed for the completion of the infectious process including RPs. Viral protein biosynthesis involves the interaction of numerous RPs with viral mRNA, proteins which are necessary for viruses replication regulation and infection inside the host cells. Most of these interactions are crucial for virus activation and accumulation. However, only small percentage of these proteins is specifically responsible for host cells protection by triggering the immune pathway against virus. This research proposes RPs extracted from 
Mitochondrial-targeted ubiquinone: A potential treatment for COVID-19;Immune dysregulation characterized by T cell exhaustion and high level of inflammatory cytokines is associated with severe COVID-19. Figuring out the early event of immune dysregulation would provide a potential treatment for COVID-19. Recent evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction participates in the development of COVID-19 and may be responsible for the dysregulated immune response. Mitochondrial-targeted ubiquinone (MitoQ), a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, shows beneficial effects on various diseases through improving mitochondrial dysfunction. We hypothesize that MitoQ could act as a potential treatment in COVID-19. MitoQ may alleviate cytokine storm and restore the function of exhausted T cells in COVID-19 patients through improving mitochondrial dysfunction. In this article, we provide evidence to support the use of MitoQ as a potential treatment or adjunct therapy in the context of COVID-19.
Antecedent immunosuppressive therapy for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases in the setting of a COVID-19 outbreak;Finite clinical data and understanding of COVID-19 immunopathology has led to limited, opinion-based recommendations for the management of patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID) receiving immunosuppressive (IS) therapeutics.
Follow-up studies in COVID-19 recovered patients - is it mandatory?;The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an illness caused due to Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this outbreak a global health emergency and as on April 24, 2020, it has spread to 213 countries, with 25,91,015 confirmed cases and 742,855 cases have been recovered from COVID-19. In this dreadful situation our team has already published an article in the Science of the Total Environment, which elaborates the various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this situation, it is imperative to understand the possible outcome of COVID-19 recovered patients and determine if they have any other detrimental illnesses by longitudinal analysis to safeguard their life in future. It is necessary to follow-up these recovered patients and performs comprehensive assessments for detection and appropriate management towards their psychological, physical, and social realm. This urges us to suggest that it is highly important to provide counselling, moral support as well as a few recommended guidelines to the recovered patients and society to restore to normalcy. Epidemiological, clinical and immunological studies from COVID-19 recovered patients are particularly important to understand the disease and to prepare better for potential outbreaks in the future. Longitudinal studies on a larger cohort would help us to understand the in-depth prognosis as well as the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Also, follow-up studies will help us provide more information for the development of vaccines and drugs for these kinds of pandemics in the future. Hence, we recommend more studies are required to unravel the possible mechanism of COVID-19 infection and the after-effects of it to understand the characteristics of the virus and to develop the necessary precautionary measures to prevent it.

COVID-19: Poor outcomes in patients with zinc deficiency;Zinc is a trace element with potent immunoregulatory and antiviral properties, and is utilized in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, we do not know the clinical significance of serum Zinc levels in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical significance of serum zinc in COVID-19 patients and to establish a correlation with disease severity.
Clinical impact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer (CCC19): a cohort study;Data on patients with COVID-19 who have cancer are lacking. Here we characterise the outcomes of a cohort of patients with cancer and COVID-19 and identify potential prognostic factors for mortality and severe illness.
Recombinant protein targeting and opsonizing spike glycoprotein for enhancing SARS-CoV-2 phagocytosis;The present hypothesis suggests an innovative therapeutic strategy to cease Covid 19 infection. It is based on the inhibition of Spike glycoprotein and ACE-2 receptor interaction that provides the entry of virus in human host cells, by targeting the S protein with a recombinant molecule made of the ACE-2 receptor ectodomain and an opsonin, the formed complex would enhance its phagocytosis.
Unheralded Lower limb threatening ischemia in a COVID-19 patient;Acute thromboembolic events appear to be frequent in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We report a case of an intubated patient, who developed a threatening lower limb ischemia. Intra-arterial fibrinolysis and intravenous heparin infusion did not lead to complete recanalization of the tibial arteries, which were successfully treated by surgical embolectomy.
Risk of COVID-19 in health-care workers in Denmark: an observational cohort study;Health-care workers are thought to be highly exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in health-care workers and the proportion of seroconverted health-care workers with previous symptoms of COVID-19.
Efficacy and Safety of Favipiravir, an Oral RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Inhibitor, in Mild-to-Moderate COVID-19: A Randomized, Comparative, Open-Label, Multicenter, Phase 3 Clinical Trial;To assess efficacy and safety of favipiravir in adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.
Mevalonate pathway, selenoproteins, redox balance, immune system, Covid-19: Reasoning about connections;It has been proposed that a degraded immune system is (one of) the condition(s) that predispose certain subjects to fatal consequences from infection by SARS-CoV-2. It is unknown whether therapeutic regimens to which these patients may have been subjected to in the months/years preceding the infection could be immunocompromising. Statins are among the most widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs. As competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA-reductase, the key enzyme of the “mevalonate pathway” through which essential compounds, not only cholesterol, are synthesized, statins decrease the levels of cholesterol, and thus LDLs, as an innate defense mechanism, with controversial results in decreasing mortality from cardiovascular disease. Moreover, statins have pleiotropic, mostly deleterious effects on many cell types, including immune cells. In the attempt to decipher the enigma of SARS-CoV-2 infectivology, the hypothesis should be tested whether the population of subjects who succumbed to Covid-19 may have developed a compromised immunity at sub-clinical levels and have become more susceptible to fatal consequences from SARS-Cov-2 infection due to statin therapy.
COVID-19 inflammation results in urine cytokine elevation and causes COVID-19 associated cystitis (CAC);Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a wide range of symptoms, including several unexpected symptoms such as loss of taste, skin changes, and eye problems. We recently observed patients with documented COVID-19 develop de novo severe genitourinary symptoms, most notably urinary frequency of ≥ 13 episodes/24 h and nocturia ≥ 4 episodes/night. We call these associated urinary symptoms COVID-19 associate cystitis (CAC). COVID-19 severity is associated with inflammation. We collected urine samples from COVID-19 patients, including patients with CAC, and found elevation of proinflammatory cytokines also in the urine. It has been previously shown that patients with urinary incontinence and ulcerative interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome have elevated urinary inflammatory cytokines compared to normal controls. We therefore hypothesize that CAC, with presentation of de novo severe urinary symptoms, can occur in COVID-19 and is caused by increased inflammatory cytokines that are released into the urine and/or expressed in the bladder.
COVID-19 outbreak: Migration, effects on society, global environment and prevention;The COVID-19 pandemic is considered as the most crucial global health calamity of the century and the greatest challenge that the humankind faced since the 2nd World War. In December 2019, a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China and was named by the World Health Organization as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). A new class of corona virus, known as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has been found to be responsible for occurrence of this disease. As far as the history of human civilization is concerned there are instances of severe outbreaks of diseases caused by a number of viruses. According to the report of the World Health Organization (WHO as of April 18 2020), the current outbreak of COVID-19, has affected over 2164111 people and killed more than 146,198 people in more than 200 countries throughout the world. Till now there is no report of any clinically approved antiviral drugs or vaccines that are effective against COVID-19. It has rapidly spread around the world, posing enormous health, economic, environmental and social challenges to the entire human population. The coronavirus outbreak is severely disrupting the global economy. Almost all the nations are struggling to slow down the transmission of the disease by testing & treating patients, quarantining suspected persons through contact tracing, restricting large gatherings, maintaining complete or partial lock down etc. This paper describes the impact of COVID-19 on society and global environment, and the possible ways in which the disease can be controlled has also been discussed therein.
Is hesperidin essential for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 Infection?;SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 is representing the major global burden that implicated more than 4.7 million infected cases and 310 thousand deaths worldwide in less than 6 months. The prevalence of this pandemic disease is expected to rise every day. The challenge is to control its rapid spread meanwhile looking for a specific treatment to improve patient outcomes. Hesperidin is a classical herbal medicine used worldwide for a long time with an excellent safety profile. Hesperidin is a well-known herbal medication used as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Available shreds of evidence support the promising use of hesperidin in prophylaxis and treatment of COVID 19. Herein, we discuss the possible prophylactic and treatment mechanisms of hesperidin based on previous and recent findings. Hesperidin can block coronavirus from entering host cells through ACE2 receptors which can prevent the infection. Anti-viral activity of hesperidin might constitute a treatment option for COVID-19 through improving host cellular immunity against infection and its good anti-inflammatory activity may help in controlling cytokine storm. Hesperidin mixture with diosmin co-administrated with heparin protect against venous thromboembolism which may prevent disease progression. Based on that, hesperidin might be used as a meaningful prophylactic agent and a promising adjuvant treatment option against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
COVIDiagnosis-Net: Deep Bayes-SqueezeNet based diagnosis of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from X-ray images;The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has a tremendous impact on global health and the daily life of people still living in more than two hundred countries. The crucial action to gain the force in the fight of COVID-19 is to have powerful monitoring of the site forming infected patients. Most of the initial tests rely on detecting the genetic material of the coronavirus, and they have a poor detection rate with the time-consuming operation. In the ongoing process, radiological imaging is also preferred where chest X-rays are highlighted in the diagnosis. Early studies express the patients with an abnormality in chest X-rays pointing to the presence of the COVID-19. On this motivation, there are several studies cover the deep learning-based solutions to detect the COVID-19 using chest X-rays. A part of the existing studies use non-public datasets, others perform on complicated Artificial Intelligent (AI) structures. In our study, we demonstrate an AI-based structure to outperform the existing studies. The SqueezeNet that comes forward with its light network design is tuned for the COVID-19 diagnosis with Bayesian optimization additive. Fine-tuned hyperparameters and augmented dataset make the proposed network perform much better than existing network designs and to obtain a higher COVID-19 diagnosis accuracy.
It is time to drop hydroxychloroquine from our COVID-19 armamentarium;Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were among the first drugs repurposed for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A few in vitro studies confirmed that both drugs exhibited dose dependent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities. These observations and the encouraging results from early poorly conducted observational studies created a major hype about the therapeutic potential of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 disease. This was further catalyzed by media and political influences leading to a widespread use of these agents. Subsequent randomized trials revealed lack of efficacy of these agents in improving the outcomes of COVID-19 or in preventing infection in post-exposure prophylaxis studies. Nevertheless, many ongoing trials continue to actively recruit tens of thousands of patients to receive HCQ worldwide. In this perspective, we address the possible mechanisms behind the lack of efficacy and the increased risk of cardiac toxicity of HCQ in COVID-19 disease. For the lack of efficacy, we discuss the fundamental differences of treatment initiation between in vitro and in vivo studies, the pitfalls of the pharmacological calculations of effective blood drug concentrations and related dosing regimens, and the possible negative effect of HCQ on the antiviral type-I interferon response. Although it has been repeatedly claimed that HCQ has a longstanding safety track record for many decades in use, we present counterarguments for this contention due to disease-drug and drug-drug interactions. We discuss the molecular mechanisms and the cumulative epidemiological evidence of HCQ cardiac toxicity.
Non-invasive assessment of endothelial dysfunction: A novel method to predict severe COVID-19?;The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected millions and overburdened the healthcare infrastructure globally. Recent studies show that the endothelial dysfunction caused by the virus contributes to its high morbidity and mortality. A parameter that can identify patients who will develop complications early will be valuable in patient management and reducing the burden on medical resources. An emerging technology is currently being tested to predict the cardiovascular risk via non-invasively measuring the endothelial dysfunction. This paper reviews how the assessment of endothelial dysfunction using this technology can be used as a potential parameter in the prognostication and management of COVID-19 patients.
The influence of ABO blood groups on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity: A molecular hypothesis based on carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions;The world is experiencing one of the most difficult moments in history with the COVID-19 pandemic, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a new type of coronavirus. Virus infectivity is mediated by the binding of Spike transmembrane glycoprotein to specific protein receptors present on cell host surface. Spike is a homotrimer that emerges from the virion, each monomer containing two subunits named S1 and S2, which are related to cell recognition and membrane fusion, respectively. S1 is subdivided in domains S1A (or NTD) and S1B (or RBD), with experimental and 
Estrogen shields women from COVID-19 complications by reducing ER stress;Estrogen hormone acts as a potential key player in providing immunity against certain viral infection. It is found to be associated in providing immunity against acute lungs inflammation and influenza virus by modulating cytokines storm and mediating adaptive immune alterations respectively. Women are less affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection because of the possible influence of estrogen hormone as compared to men. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 causes stress in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which in turn aggravates the infection, estrogen hormone might play key role in decreasing ER stress by activating estrogen mediated signaling pathways, results in unfolded protein response (UPR). Estrogen governs degradation of phosphotidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP
COVID-19: Does the infectious inoculum dose-response relationship contribute to understanding heterogeneity in disease severity and transmission dynamics?;The variation in the speed and intensity of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and severity of the resulting COVID-19 disease are still imperfectly understood. We postulate a dose-response relationship in COVID-19, and that “the dose of virus in the initial inoculum” is an important missing link in understanding several incompletely explained observations in COVID-19 as a factor in transmission dynamics and severity of disease. We hypothesize that: (1) Viral dose in inoculum is related to severity of disease, (2) Severity of disease is related to transmission potential, and (3) In certain contexts, chains of severe cases can build up to severe local outbreaks, and large-scale intensive epidemics. Considerable evidence from other infectious diseases substantiates this hypothesis and recent evidence from COVID-19 points in the same direction. We suggest research avenues to validate the hypothesis. If proven, our hypothesis could strengthen the scientific basis for deciding priority containment measures in various contexts in particular the importance of avoiding super-spreading events and the benefits of mass masking.
Investigation of three clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore: implications for surveillance and response measures;Three clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) linked to a tour group from China, a company conference, and a church were identified in Singapore in February, 2020.
Factors associated with negative conversion of viral RNA in patients hospitalized with COVID-19;Factors associated with negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in hospitalized patients have not yet been systematically determined. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, China. Both univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify independent factors for time to viral RNA negative conversion. Data on patients with re-detectable viral RNA after showing negative on RT-PCR test (intermittent negative status) were also analyzed. A total of 59 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were included in this study, with a median duration of 1 (interquartile range, IQR: 0–2) day from symptom onset to hospital admission. Median communicable period (from first day of positive nucleic acid test to first day of consecutive negative results) was 14 (IQR: 10–18) days, and 7 (IQR: 6–10) days for 10 patients with intermittent negative results. Age older than 45 years (hazard ratio, HR: 0.378
Algorithms for testing COVID-19 focused on use of RT-PCR and high-affinity serological testing: A consensus statement from a panel of Latin American experts;The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented public health, social, and economic crisis. Improving understanding on available tests for detecting COVID-19 is critical for effective management of the pandemic. We proposed that a multidisciplinary expert panel can establish recommendations on ideal use of diagnostic tools, with a focus on RT-PCR and serological high-affinity antibodies (both IgM and IgG) tests for the Latin America region.
Ankaferd hemostat (ABS) as a potential mucosal topical agent for the management of COVID-19 syndrome based on its PAR-1 inhibitory effect and oestrogen content;COVID-19 due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection is a multi-systemic immune syndrome affecting mainly the lungs, oropharyngeal region, and other vascular endothelial beds. There are tremendous ongoing efforts for the aim of developing drugs against the COVID-19 syndrome-associated inflammation. However, currently no specific medicine is present for the absolute pharmacological cure of COVID-19 mucositis. The re-purposing/re-positioning of already existing drugs is a very important strategy for the management of ongoing pandemy since the development of a new drug needs decades. Apart from altering angiotensin signaling pathways, novel drug candidates for re-purposing comprise medications shall target COVID-19 pathobiology, including pharmaceutical formulations that antagonize proteinase-activated receptors (PARs), mainly PAR-1. Activation of the PAR-1, mediators and hormones impact on the hemostasis, endothelial activation, alveolar epithelial cells and mucosal inflammatory responses which are the essentials of the COVID-19 pathophysiology. In this context, Ankaferd hemostat (Ankaferd Blood Stopper, ABS) which is an already approved hemostatic agent affecting via vital erythroid aggregation and fibrinogen gamma could be a potential topical remedy for the mucosal management of COVID-19. ABS is a clinically safe and effective topical hemostatic agent of plant origin capable of exerting pleiotropic effects on the endothelial cells, angiogenesis, cell proliferation and vascular dynamics. ABS had been approved as a topically applied hemostatic agent for the management of post-surgical/dental bleedings and healing of infected inflammatory mucosal wounds. The anti-inflammatory and proteinase-activated receptor axis properties of ABS with a considerable amount of oestrogenic hormone presence highlight this unique topical hemostatic drug regarding the clinical re-positioning for COVID-19-associated mucositis. Topical ABS as a biological response modifier may lessen SARS-CoV-2 associated microthrombosis, endothelial dysfunction, oropharyngeal inflammation and mucosal lung damage. Moreover, PAR-1 inhibition ability of ABS might be helpful for reducing the initial virus propagation and mocasal spread of COVID-19.
Environmental side effects of the injudicious use of antimicrobials in the era of COVID-19;Use of antimicrobials in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is on the rise. The increased use of antimicrobials can have serious consequences on the environment. Antibiotics have had a reasonable role in bacterial co-infections with regards to the management of COVID-19. However, recent evidences suggest that there has been injudicious prescription of antimicrobials. Moreover, a large number of people are self-medicating with antibiotics in a misguided attempt to protect themselves from the virus. This practice is especially prevalent in developing communities. Although common soaps are effective at inactivating enveloped viruses, such as the SARS-CoV-2, use of antibacterial products bearing biocides has increased during this pandemic. Current wastewater treatment techniques are unable to offer complete elimination of antibacterial biocides. These compounds can then accumulate in different environmental compartments thus, disrupting the functioning of native microbes. These microbes are involved in the biogeochemical cycling of elements and environmental remediation. In addition, the presence of antimicrobial elements in the environment can stimulate antimicrobial resistance. Concrete actions are needed to address this issue. Development of an antimicrobial policy specific for COVID-19 is urgently needed. Investments into improving wastewater infrastructure as well as public awareness is crucial. Moreover, global monitoring programs and multidisciplinary collaborations are required to understand the environmental impact of this pandemics.
Associations between mortality from COVID-19 in two Italian regions and outdoor air pollution as assessed through tropospheric nitrogen dioxide;After the appearance of COVID-19 in China last December 2019, Italy was the first European country to be severely affected by the outbreak. The first diagnosis in Italy was on February 20, 2020, followed by the establishment of a light and a tight lockdown on February 23 and on March 8, 2020, respectively. The virus spread rapidly, particularly in the North of the country in the ‘Padan Plain’ area, known as one of the most polluted regions in Europe. Air pollution has been recently hypothesized to enhance the clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, acting through adverse effects on immunity, induction of respiratory and other chronic disease, upregulation of viral receptor ACE-2, and possible pathogen transportation as a virus carrier. We investigated the association between air pollution and subsequent COVID-19 mortality rates within two Italian regions (Veneto and Emilia-Romagna). We estimated ground-level nitrogen dioxide through its tropospheric levels using data available from the Sentinel-5P satellites of the European Space Agency Copernicus Earth Observation Programme before the lockdown. We then examined COVID-19 mortality rates in relation to the nitrogen dioxide levels at three 14-day lag points after the lockdown, namely March 8, 22 and April 5, 2020. Using a multivariable negative binomial regression model, we found an association between nitrogen dioxide and COVID-19 mortality. Although ecological data provide only weak evidence, these findings indicate an association between air pollution levels and COVID-19 severity.
Exercise as medicine for COVID-19: On PPAR with emerging pharmacotherapy;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may have a metabolic origin given strong links with risk factors such as lipids and glucose and co-morbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein mediates viral cellular entry via the ACE2 receptor. The cytoplasmic tail of this spike protein is heavily palmitoylated. Emerging studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 alters lipid metabolism in the lung epithelial cells by modulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), possibly contributing to lipotoxicity, inflammation and untoward respiratory effects. Disruption of this process may affect palmitoylation of SARS-CoV spike protein and thus infectivity and viral assembly. COVID-19 is also increasingly being recognized as a vascular disease, with several studies noting prominent systemic endothelial dysfunction. The pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction may also be linked to COVID-19-mediated metabolic and inflammatory effects. Herein, exercise will be compared to fenofibrate as a possible therapeutic strategy to bolster resilience against (and help manage recovery from) COVID-19. This paper will explore the hypothesis that exercise may be a useful adjuvant in a setting of COVID-19 management/rehabilitation due to its effects on PPARα and vascular endothelial function.
Clinical characteristics and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women: a retrospective review of medical records;Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population. Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.
Paromomycin: A potential dual targeted drug effectively inhibits both spike (S1) and main protease of COVID-19;With the increasing number of people suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is a dire need to look for effective remedies against this pandemic. Drug repurposing seems to be the solution for the current situation.
Transmission of COVID-19 in the terminal stages of the incubation period: A familial cluster;We report a familial cluster of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to assess its potential transmission during the incubation period. The first patient in this familial cluster was identified during the presymptomatic period, as a close contact of a confirmed patient. Five family members had close contact with this first patient during his incubation period, with four of them confirmed positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the subsequent sampling tests.
Does zinc supplementation enhance the clinical efficacy of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine to win today's battle against COVID-19?;Currently, drug repurposing is an alternative to novel drug development for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ) and its metabolite hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are currently being tested in several clinical studies as potential candidates to limit SARS-CoV-2-mediated morbidity and mortality. CQ and HCQ (CQ/HCQ) inhibit pH-dependent steps of SARS-CoV-2 replication by increasing pH in intracellular vesicles and interfere with virus particle delivery into host cells. Besides direct antiviral effects, CQ/HCQ specifically target extracellular zinc to intracellular lysosomes where it interferes with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and coronavirus replication. As zinc deficiency frequently occurs in elderly patients and in those with cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, or diabetes, we hypothesize that CQ/HCQ plus zinc supplementation may be more effective in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality than CQ or HCQ in monotherapy. Therefore, CQ/HCQ in combination with zinc should be considered as additional study arm for COVID-19 clinical trials.
Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) gene polymorphism as determinant of differences in Covid-19-related disease severity;Covid-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has major world-wide health-related and socio-economic consequences. There are large disparities in the burden of Covid-19 with an apparent lower risk of poor outcomes in East Asians compared to populations in the West. A recent study suggested that Covid-19 leads to a severe extrahepatic vitamin K insufficiency, which could lead to impaired activation of extrahepatic proteins like endothelial anticoagulant protein S in the presence of normal hepatic procoagulant activity. This would be compatible with the enhanced thrombogenicity in severe Covid-19. The same study showed that vitamin K antagonists (VKA) that inhibit vitamin K recycling, had a greater impact on procoagulant activity than on the activation of extrahepatic vitamin K-dependent proteins during SARS-CoV-2 infections. A genetic polymorphism in the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1, VKORC1 −1639A, is particularly prevalent in East Asia and associates with low vitamin K recycling rates. Carriage of the allele may be regarded as bioequivalent to low-dose VKA use. We speculate that VKORC1 −1639A confers protection against thrombotic complications of Covid-19 and that differences in its allele frequency are partially responsible for the differences in Covid-19 severity between East and West.
Coronavirus 2019-nCoV: A brief perspective from the front line;A novel coronavirus, designated as 2019-nCoV, hit the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late December 2019, and subsequently spread rapidly to all provinces of China and multiple countries. As of 0:00 am February 9, 2020, a total of 37,287 cases have been confirmed infection of 2019-nCoV in China mainland, and 302 cases have also been cumulatively reported from 24 countries. According to the latest data, a total of 813 deaths occurred in China mainland, with the mortality reaching approximately 2.2%. At present, there is no vaccine or specific drugs for the human coronavirus. Therefore, it is critical to understand the nature of the virus and its clinical characteristics, in order to respond to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Thus, the present study briefly but comprehensively summarizes the not much but timely reports on the 2019-nCoV.
Severe air pollution links to higher mortality in COVID-19 patients: The “double-hit” hypothesis.;In areas of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak worldwide mean air pollutants concentrations vastly exceed the maximum limits. Chronic exposure to air pollutants have been associated with lung ACE-2 over-expression which is known to be the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between air pollutants concentration (PM 2.5 and NO2) and COVID-19 outbreak, in terms of transmission, number of patients, severity of presentation and number of deaths.
Mucocutaneous Disease and Related Clinical Characteristics in Hospitalized Children and Adolescents with COVID-19 and MIS-C;Little is known about mucocutaneous disease in acutely-ill children and adolescents with COVID-19 and MIS-C.
5-Fluorouracil in combination with deoxyribonucleosides and deoxyribose as possible therapeutic options for the Coronavirus, COVID-19 infection;The recent global pandemic created by the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, started in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has generated panic, both in term of human death (4–5% of infected patients identified through testing) and the global economy. Human suffering
Impact of tocilizumab on mortality and/or invasive mechanical ventilation requirement in a cohort of 206 COVID-19 patients;No therapy has proven to be effective yet to reduce mortality and/or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) requirement in COVID-19. Tocilizumab (TCZ) in patients with severe COVID-19 could be an effective treatment.
Severe COVID-19 Infection and Pediatric Comorbidities: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis;What is known
A case of extremely prolonged viral shedding: could cell cultures be a diagnostic tool to drive the COVID-19 patients discharge?;This study addresses the case of a patient with prolonged viral shedding reported by Real-Time PCR, until 71 days from symptoms onset. However, viral culture got negative results after 30 days from symptoms onset. Viral culture may thus be a worthwhile test for patients discharge, in particular for those presenting prolonged viral shedding.
What would Sérgio Ferreira say to your physician in this war against COVID-19: How about kallikrein/kinin system?;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with fast spreading all over the world caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus which can culminate in a severe acute respiratory syndrome by the injury caused in the lungs. However, other organs can be also damaged. SARS-CoV-2 enter into the host cells using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as receptor, like its ancestor SARS-CoV. ACE2 is then downregulated in lung tissues with augmented serum levels of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Interestingly, ACE2
Estimates of the rate of infection and asymptomatic COVID-19 disease in a population sample from SE England;Understanding of the true asymptomatic rate of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is currently limited, as is understanding of the population-based seroprevalence after the first wave of COVID-19 within the UK. The majority of data thus far come from hospitalised patients, with little focus on general population cases, or their symptoms.
Why the lower reported prevalence of asthma in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 validates repurposing EDTA solutions to prevent and manage treat COVID-19 disease;There currently is no specific antiviral drug or a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infections
Prior infection with intestinal coronaviruses moderates symptom severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19: A hypothesis and preliminary evidence;The pandemic of acute respiratory illness caused by the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, officially designated COVID-19, has attained the proportions of a global health crisis. Though all nations of the world have been affected by this disease, there have been marked cross-national variations in prevalence, severity and mortality rates. Various explanations, based on demographic, social and climatic factors, have been suggested to account for this variability, but these remain unverified to date. Based on recent research findings suggesting that human enterocytes may serve as a point of entry for SARS-CoV-2, leading to intestinal viral replication, this paper puts forward the hypothesis that prior intestinal infection with coronaviruses, either symptomatic or asymptomatic, may moderate this process and minimize the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This hypothesis is supported by evidence on the gastrointestinal manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and related infections, on the geographical patterns observed in the variability of COVID-19 mortality, and on the occurrence and geographical distribution of outbreaks of diarrheal disease, as well as asymptomatic infection, with human coronaviruses as verified by direct or serological testing. Preliminary supporting evidence based on national and international health statistics is presented, along with suggestions on more robust methods by which this hypothesis may be tested. If the proposal put forth in this paper can be confirmed either wholly or in part, it would have significant implications in terms of strategies aimed at minimizing the severity of COVID-19 in a clinical setting.
Is the anti-filarial drug diethylcarbamazine useful to treat COVID-19?;SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in a devastating pandemic of COVID-19. Exploring compounds that could offer a breakthrough in treatment is the need of the hour. Re-positioning cheap, freely available and safe drugs is a priority. The paper proposes evidence for the potential use of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) in the treatment of COVID-19. DEC has inhibitory effects on arachidonic acid metabolism to prostaglandins, little known anti-viral effects on animal retroviruses and demonstrated anti-inflammatory actions in animal models of lung inflammation indicating the need to explore this hypothesis further. We believe this is the first time DEC is being proposed to treat COVID-19.
Arbidol monotherapy is superior to lopinavir/ritonavir in treating COVID-19;Lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol have been previously used to treat acute respiratory syndrome- coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication in clinical practice
Environmental pollutant exposure can exacerbate COVID-19 neurologic symptoms;Neurologic symptoms have been reported in some COVID-19 patients. However, little is known on what factors influence the risk of developing these symptoms. While some studies suggest that exposure to pollution is associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, its role is unknown in the development of neurologic symptoms in COVID-19 patients. The response of the central nervous system (CNS) to a SARS-CoV-2 infection may be influenced by its inflammatory state. Interestingly, environmental pollutants such as particulate matter may have neuroinflammatory effects, providing a possible link between exposure to these pollutants and the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS. This article explores the hypothesis that the neurologic symptoms in COVID-19 may be exacerbated through a neuroinflammatory mechanism that is promoted by environmental pollutant exposure.
COVID-19 and Nigeria: putting the realities in context;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was previously known as 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The disease evolved into a serious global emergency, leading to its declaration as a pandemic.
Survey of antibiotic and antifungal prescribing in patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 in Scottish hospitals;Concern regarding bacterial co-infection complicating SARS-CoV-2 has created a challenge for antimicrobial stewardship. Following introduction of national antibiotic recommendations for suspected bacterial respiratory tract infection complicating COVID-19, a point prevalence survey of prescribing was conducted across acute hospitals in Scotland.
Cytochrome P450-mediated drug interactions in COVID-19 patients: Current findings and possible mechanisms;At the end of 2019, the entire world has witnessed the birth of a new member of coronavirus family in Wuhan, China. Ever since, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has swiftly invaded every corner on the planet. By the end of April 2020, almost 3.5 million cases have been reported worldwide, with a death toll of about 250,000 deaths. It is currently well-recognized that patient’s immune response plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This inflammatory element was evidenced by its elevated mediators that, in severe cases, reach their peak in a cytokine storm. Together with the reported markers of liver injury, such hyperinflammatory state may trigger significant derangements in hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolic machinery, and subsequent modulation of drug clearance that may result in unexpected therapeutic/toxic response. We hypothesize that COVID-19 patients are potentially vulnerable to a significant disease-drug interaction, and therefore, suitable dosing guidelines with therapeutic drug monitoring should be implemented to assure optimal clinical outcomes.
Snapshot PCR surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in hospital staff in England;Significant nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated. Understanding the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriage amongst HCWs at work is necessary to inform the development of HCW screening programmes to control nosocomial spread.
SARS-CoV-2 dysregulation of PTBP1 and YWHAE/Z gene expression: A primer of neurodegeneration;SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism has been increasingly recognized by its imaging and syndromic manifestations in the literature. The purpose of this report is to explore the limited yet salient current evidence that SARS-CoV-2′s host genomic targets PTBP1 and the 14-3-3 protein isoform encoding genes YWHAE and YWHAZ may be hold the key to understanding how neurotropism triggers neurodegeneration and how it may contribute to the onset of neurodegenerative disease. Considering that PTBP1 silencing in particular has recently been shown to reverse clinical parkinsonism and induce neurogenesis, as well as the known interactions of PTBP1 and YWHAE/Z with coronaviruses – most notably 14-3-3 and SARS-CoV, recent studies reinvigorate the infectious etiology hypotheses on major neurodegenerative disease such as AD and iPD. Considering that human coronaviruses with definite neurotropism have been shown to achieve long-term latency within the mammalian CNS as a result of specific accommodating mutations, the corroboration of genomic-level evidence with neuroimaging has vast potential implications for neurodegenerative disease.
Factors related to asymptomatic or severe COVID-19 infection;The factors that may contribute to a COVID-19 patient remaining in the asymptomatic stage, or to the infection evolving into the more serious stages are examined. In particular, we refer to the TMPRSS2 expression profile, balance of androgen and estrogen, blood group-A and/or B, nonsynonymous mutations in ORF3, and proteins NS7b and NS8 in SARS-CoV-2. Also, we review other factors related to the susceptibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.
Is a COVID-19 vaccine developed by nature already at work?;The COVID-19 positive cases are increasing at an alarming rate across the world. On the contrary, the morbidity and mortality are showing decreasing trend as time progresses. The most intriguing part is the rise in asymptomatic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive cases in the population, which made us speculate some kind of gradual development of immunity in the population. To date, no attention has been given to the accumulation of killed/inactivated/degenerated SARS-CoV-2 associated molecular particle patterns (SAMPPs). In this paper, we introduced the concept of SAMMPs and its existence on inanimate objects is quite conceivable due to the size of SARS-CoV-2 and exuberant shedding of the virus in respiratory secretions. SAMPPs can come into the contact with mucosal surfaces and thereof associated antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Thus, we hypothesized the existence of SAMPPs mediated the development of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which has caused an increase in the incidence rate of asymptomatic cases and a decrease in mortality rate. To understand the existence of SAMPPs associated natural immunity against SARS-CoV-2, future population based serological testing are recommended to investigate serum antibody levels against various molecular particles associated with SAMPPs.
The viral protein fragment theory of COVID-19 pathogenesis;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has killed nearly one million people so far. While this is a respiratory virus, surprisingly, it has been recognized that patients with cardiovascular disease are likely to be affected severely and die of COVID-19. This phenomenon cannot be explained by the generally accepted logic that the SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication is the sole determinant of the actions of the virus to define the fate of host cells. I herein propose the 
Clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective, single-centre, descriptive study;In December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China. The number of affected pregnant women is increasing, but scarce information is available about the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19.
Household transmission of SARS-CoV-2;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused an epidemic in China and many other countries. Many infected clusters have been found within familial households, but the data about secondary transmission among household contacts is limited.
Reposition of montelukast either alone or in combination with levocetirizine against SARS-CoV-2;It has been hypothesised that antiallergic medications (AAMs) like montelukast and levocetirizine both the two bitter chloro compounds could be repurposed either alone or combinedly as an antiviral against SARS-CoV-2, like chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ), another two bitter chloro compounds. Both AAMs and CQ/HCQ are bitter tasted chloro compounds. Depending on their these two similar physical properties and the safety and efficacy of AAMs by controlling over post viral episodes as comparing with viral inhibitory activities including SARS-CoV-2 by CQ/HCQ, a reposition of AAMs either alone/combinedly could be rationalised as an antiviral approach to nCoV.
Hypothesis: Alpha-1-antitrypsin is a promising treatment option for COVID-19;No definitive treatment for COVID-19 exists although promising results have been reported with remdesivir and glucocorticoids. Short of a truly effective preventive or curative vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, it is becoming increasingly clear that multiple pathophysiologic processes seen with COVID-19 as well as SARS-CoV-2 itself should be targeted. Because alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) embraces a panoply of biologic activities that may antagonize several pathophysiologic mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesize that this naturally occurring molecule is a promising agent to ameliorate COVID-19. We posit at least seven different mechanisms by which AAT may alleviate COVID-19. First, AAT is a serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) shown to inhibit TMPRSS-2, the host serine protease that cleaves the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, a necessary preparatory step for the virus to bind its cell surface receptor ACE2 to gain intracellular entry. Second, AAT has anti-viral activity against other RNA viruses HIV and influenza as well as induces autophagy, a known host effector mechanism against MERS-CoV, a related coronavirus that causes the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Third, AAT has potent anti-inflammatory properties, in part through inhibiting both nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) activation and ADAM17 (also known as tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme), and thus may dampen the hyper-inflammatory response of COVID-19. Fourth, AAT inhibits neutrophil elastase, a serine protease that helps recruit potentially injurious neutrophils and implicated in acute lung injury. AAT inhibition of ADAM17 also prevents shedding of ACE2 and hence may preserve ACE2 inhibition of bradykinin, reducing the ability of bradykinin to cause a capillary leak in COVID-19. Fifth, AAT inhibits thrombin, and venous thromboembolism and 
CT imaging and clinical course of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia at admission in Wuhan, China;Aimed to characterize the CT imaging and clinical course of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia.
Diagnostic performance of commercially available COVID-19 serology tests in Brazil;Timely and accurate laboratory testing is essential for managing the global COVID-19 pandemic. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction remains the gold-standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, but several practical issues limit the test’s use. Immunoassays have been indicated as an alternative for individual and mass testing. Objectives: To access the performance of 12 serological tests for COVID-19 diagnosis.
Could imiquimod (Aldara 5% cream) or other TLR7 agonists be used in the treatment of COVID-19?;Toll-like receptor 7 is critical in recognition of single strand RNA viruses, including SARS CoV-2, and generation of anti-viral immunity. Coronaviruses evolved strategies to dampen the host immunity. Herein, we discuss the potential use of TLR7 agonists in the early stages of COVID-19 treatment.
Early dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study;An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95 333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.
SARS-CoV-2 in Migrant Worker Dormitories: Geospatial Epidemiology Supporting Outbreak Management;Migrant worker dormitories—residential complexes where 10–24 workers share living spaces—account for the majority of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore. To prevent spill-over of transmission to the wider population, starting in early April 2020, residents were confined to their dormitories while measures were put in place to arrest the spread of infection. In this descriptive study we present epidemiological data for a population of more than 60,000 migrant workers living in two barracks-style and four apartment-style dormitories located in western Singapore from 03 April to 10 June 2020.
Mortality and pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection: an international cohort study;The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on postoperative recovery needs to be understood to inform clinical decision making during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reports 30-day mortality and pulmonary complication rates in patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Evaluating the efficacy of RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 direct approaches in comparison to RNA extraction;The genetic identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is based on viral RNA extraction prior to RT-qPCR assay, however recent studies, using different buffers, support the elimination of the extraction step (direct approaches).
Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via fecal-oral and aerosols–borne routes: Environmental dynamics and implications for wastewater management in underprivileged societies;The advent of novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its potential transmission via fecal-oral and aerosols-borne routes are upcoming challenges to understand the fate of the virus in the environment. In this short communication, we specifically looked at the possibilities of these transmission routes based on the available literature directly related to the SARS-CoV-2 as well as on the closer phylogenetic relatives such as SARS-CoV-1. The available data suggest that, in addition to human-to-human contact, the virus may spread via fecal-oral and aerosols-borne routes. Existing knowledge states that coronaviruses have low stability in the environment due to the natural action of oxidants that disrupt the viral envelope. Previous recommended dosage of chlorination has been found to be not sufficient to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in places where viral load is high such as hospitals and airports. Although there is no current evidence showing that coronaviruses can be transmitted through contaminated drinking water, there is a growing concern on the impact of the current pandemic wave on underprivileged societies because of their poor wastewater treatment infrastructures, overpopulation, and outbreak management strategies. More research is encouraged to trace the actual fate of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment and to develop/revise the disinfection strategies accordingly.
Bone biology and COVID-19 infection: Is ACE2 a potential influence factor?;The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a severe threat to global health management system since it has been detected in the human body. This pandemic was prompted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and rapidly developed into a public emergency with an alarming increase in cases and deaths. The increasing explorations to SARS-CoV-2 infection guide us to consider whether bone lesion is followed by this pathologic process. We especially focus on the underlying pathobiology that SARS-CoV-2 possibly mediated in bone remodeling and analyze the association of bone destruction with ACE2 in COVID-19 incidence, for preferable understanding the pathogenesis and providing necessary clinical management in orthopedics.
Addressing Africa’s pandemic puzzle: perspectives on COVID-19 infection and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa;To date, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) has spread to almost every region of the world, infecting millions and resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.
Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Geneva, Switzerland (SEROCoV-POP): a population-based study;Assessing the burden of COVID-19 on the basis of medically attended case numbers is suboptimal given its reliance on testing strategy, changing case definitions, and disease presentation. Population-based serosurveys measuring anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) antibodies provide one method for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic. Here, we estimate weekly seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population of Geneva, Switzerland, during the epidemic.
Blood clots in COVID-19 patients: Simplifying the curious mystery;The universal phenomenon of blood clotting is well known to be protective in external cellular/ tissue injury. However, the emergence of unusual thrombotic presentations in COVID-19 patients is the real concern. Interaction of the spike glycoprotein with ACE2 receptor present in the host cell surface mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 infection. New clinical findings of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are coming out every day, and one such mystery is the formation of mysterious blood clots in the various tissues and organs of COVID-19 patients, which needs critical attention. To address this issue, we hypothesis that, high ACE2 expression in the endothelium of blood vessels facilitates the high-affinity binding of SARS-CoV-2 using spike protein, causing infection and internal injury inside the vascular wall of blood vessels. This viral associated injury may directly/indirectly initiate activation of coagulation and clotting cascades forming internal blood clots. However, the presence of these clots is undesirable as they are responsible for thrombosis and need to be treated with anti-thrombotic intervention.
Comparison of virus concentration methods for the RT-qPCR-based recovery of murine hepatitis virus, a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 from untreated wastewater;There is currently a clear benefit for many countries to utilize wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as part of ongoing measures to manage the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic. Since most wastewater virus concentration methods were developed and validated for nonenveloped viruses, it is imperative to determine the efficiency of the most commonly used methods for the enveloped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Municipal wastewater seeded with a human coronavirus (CoV) surrogate, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), was used to test the efficiency of seven wastewater virus concentration methods: (A–C) adsorption-extraction with three different pre-treatment options, (D–E) centrifugal filter device methods with two different devices, (F) polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) precipitation, and (G) ultracentrifugation. MHV was quantified by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the recovery efficiency was calculated for each method. The mean MHV recoveries ranged from 26.7 to 65.7%. The most efficient methods were adsorption-extraction methods with MgCl
Prior presumed coronavirus infection reduces COVID-19 risk: A cohort study;Immunological cross-reactivity between common cold coronaviruses (CCC) and SARS-CoV-2 might account for the reduced incidence of COVID-19 in children. Evidence to support speculation includes in vitro evidence for humoral and cellular cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 in specimens obtained before the pandemic started.
The effect of ultraviolet C radiation against different N95 respirators inoculated with SARS-CoV-2;There are currently no studies that have examined whether one dosage can be uniformly applied to different respirator types to effectively decontaminate SARS-CoV-2 on N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). Health care workers have been using this disinfection method during the pandemic. Our objective was to determine the effect of UVC on SARS-CoV-2 inoculated N95 respirators and whether this was respirator material/model type dependent.
Satellite-detected tropospheric nitrogen dioxide and spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Northern Italy;Following the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) last December 2019 in China, Italy was the first European country to be severely affected, with the first local case diagnosed on 20 February 2020. The virus spread quickly, particularly in the North of Italy, with three regions (Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna) being the most severely affected. These three regions accounted for >80% of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases when the tight lockdown was established (March 8). These regions include one of Europe's areas of heaviest air pollution, the Po valley. Air pollution has been recently proposed as a possible risk factor of SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to its adverse effect on immunity and to the possibility that polluted air may even carry the virus. We investigated the association between air pollution and subsequent spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection within these regions. We collected NO
Periodontal pockets: A potential reservoir for SARS-CoV-2?;Periodontal pockets are the major clinical manifestation of Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory oral disease affecting the teeth-supporting tissues and has high prevalence in the adult population. Periodontal pockets are ideal environments for subgingival bacterial biofilms, that interact with the supragingival oral cavity, mucosal tissues of the pocket and a peripheral circulatory system. Periodontal pockets have been found to harbor viral species such as the Herpes simplex viruses’ family. Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 has gained major interest of the scientific/medical community as it caused a global pandemic (Covid-19) and paralyzed the globe with high figures of infected people worldwide. This virus behavior is still partially understood, and by analyzing some of its features we hypothesized that periodontal pocket could be a favorable anatomical niche for the virus and thus acting as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2.
The index case of SARS-CoV-2 in Scotland;Since its identification in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has infected 125,048 persons globally with cases identified in 118 countries across all continents. We report on the Scottish index case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus causing COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 infection pathogenesis is related to oxidative stress as a response to aggression;Since the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, a great effort has been made to understand this serious disease. Thousands of studies are being devoted to understanding its epidemiology, its molecular characteristics, its mechanisms, and the clinical evolution of this viral infection. However, little has been published on its pathogenesis and the host response mechanisms in the progress of the disease. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis based on strong scientific documentation, associating oxidative stress with changes found in patients with COVID-19, such as its participation in the amplification and perpetuation of the cytokine storm, coagulopathy, and cell hypoxia. Finally, we suggest a therapeutic strategy to reduce oxidative stress using antioxidants, NF-κB inhibitors, Nrf2 activators, and iron complexing agents. We believe that this hypothesis can guide new studies and therapeutic strategies on this topic.
Laboratory characteristics of patients infected with the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus;A subgroup of COVID-19 patients develop very severe disease with requirement for ICU treatment, ventilation, and ECMO therapy. Laboratory tests indicate that the immune and clotting system show marked alterations with hyper-activation, hyper-inflammation, cytokine storm development. Furthermore, organ-specific biomarkers demonstrate the involvement of cardiac muscle, kidney, and liver dysfunction in many patients. In this article the use of laboratory biomarkers is discussed with regard to their use for diagnosis, disease progression, and risk assessment.
SARS-CoV-2 shedding and seroconversion among passengers quarantined after disembarking a cruise ship: a case series;A cruise ship is a closed-off environment that simulates the basic functioning of a city in terms of living conditions and interpersonal interactions. Thus, the 
Clinical Performance Evaluation of a SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test for Determining Past Exposure to SARS-CoV-2;The true prevalence and seropositivity of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown, due to the number of asymptomatic infections and limited access to high-performance antibody tests. To fill this gap, the clinical performance of a point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Assay, a chromatographic immunoassay for detection of IgM/IgG antibodies, in near-patient settings was assessed.
Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C): Report of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of cases in Santiago de Chile during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic;To describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of hospitalized children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) in Santiago, Chile.
Connecting clusters of COVID-19: an epidemiological and serological investigation;Elucidation of the chain of disease transmission and identification of the source of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections are crucial for effective disease containment. We describe an epidemiological investigation that, with use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological assays, established links between three clusters of COVID-19.
Deceiving SARS-CoV-2 molecular-tropism clues – A combinational contemporary strategy;Several attempts to control the dreadfulness of SARS-CoV-2 are still underway. Based on the literature evidences we have speculated a prospective contemporary remedy, which was categorized into Specificity, Remedy, and a Conveyor. In which, pros and cons were discussed and inferred the possible alternatives. (a) Specificity: Implicit to express the ACE2 receptors in conveyor cells to deceive SARS-CoV-2 from prepone targets. (b) Remedy: As depletion of pulmonary surfactants causes strong acute respiratory distress syndrome, we propose an entity of a cost-effective artificial surfactant system as a remedy to pulmonary complications. (c) Conveyor: We propose red blood cells (RBCs) as a conveyor with embedded artificial surfactant and protruding ACE2 receptors for the target-specific delivery. Overall we postulate focused insights by employing a combinational contemporary strategy to steer towards a prospective direction on combating SARS-CoV-2.
Respiratory conditions in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Important considerations regarding novel treatment strategies to reduce mortality;A novel virus named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) causes symptoms that are classified as coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Respiratory conditions are extensively described among more serious cases of COVID-19, and the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the hallmark features of critical COVID-19 cases. ARDS can be directly life-threatening because it is associated with low blood oxygenation levels and can result in organ failure. There are no generally recognized effective treatments for COVID-19, but treatments are urgently needed. Anti-viral medications and vaccines are in the early developmental stages and may take many months or even years to fully develop. At present, management of COVID-19 with respiratory and ventilator support are standard therapeutic treatments, but unfortunately such treatments are associated with high mortality rates. Therefore, it is imperative to consider novel new therapeutic interventions to treat/ameliorate respiratory conditions associated with COVID-19. Alternate treatment strategies utilizing clinically available treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions, or erthropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy were hypothesized to increase oxygenation of tissues by alternative means than standard respiratory and ventilator treatments. It was also revealed that alternative treatments currently being considered for COVID-19 such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine by increasing hemoglobin production and increasing hemoglobin availability for oxygen binding and acetazolamine (for the treatment of altitude sickness) by causing hyperventilation with associated increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the blood may significantly ameliorate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms. In conclusion, is recommend, given HBOT, pRBC, and ESA therapies are currently available and routinely utilized in the treatment of other conditions, that such therapies be tried among COVID-19 patients with serious respiratory conditions and that future controlled-clinical trials explore the potential usefulness of such treatments among COVID-19 patients with respiratory conditions.
Zinc Iodide in combination with Dimethyl Sulfoxide for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections;Zinc Iodide and Dimethyl Sulfoxide compositions are proposed as therapeutic agents to treat and prevent chronic and acute viral infections including SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The therapeutic combinations have a wide range of virucidal effects on DNA and RNA containing viruses. The combinations also exhibit anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating, antifibrotic, antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidative effects. Given the fact that Zinc Iodide has been used as an oral antiseptic agent and DMSO has been already proven as a safe pharmaceutical solvent and therapeutic agent, we hypothesize that the combination of these two agents can be applied as an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment for SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infection. The therapeutic compound can be applied as both etiological and pathogenesis therapy and used as an effective and safe antiseptic (disinfectant) for human and animals as well.
A putative role for the tobacco mosaic virus in smokers’ resistance to COVID-19;Reports from various countries suggest that tobacco smoking might protect from SARS-CoV-2 infection, since the prevalence of smoking in COVID-19 hospitalized patients is lower than in the respective general population. Apart from nicotine or other chemicals contained in tobacco smoke, we propose that a single-stranded RNA virus that infects tobacco leaves, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), might be implicated in this effect. TMV, though non-pathogenic, is found in smokers’ airways, and stimulates adaptive and innate immunity, with release of specific antibodies and interferons. The latter may have preventive and/or therapeutic effects against COVID-19.
Higher binding affinity of Furin to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein D614G could be associated with higher SARS-CoV-2 infectivity;The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an exponential rise in death rates and hospitalizations. The aim of this study was to characterize the D614 G mutation of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, which may affect viral infectivity.

Epidemiological, clinical characteristics of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with abnormal imaging findings;To investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with abnormal imaging findings.
Towards a pharmacochemical hypothesis of the prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 by psychoactive substances;An increasing body of evidence suggests a protective effect of some psychoactive substances against SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus type 2). Recent findings suggest that patients with psychiatric disorders are less affected by SARS-CoV-2 than their caregivers, which may seem surprising given some of the frequent risk factors for an unfavorable course of the disease (e.g., obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases).
COVID-19: A promising cure for the global panic;The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase. When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have discussed the structure of virus
Municipal solid waste management during the SARS-COV-2 outbreak and lockdown ease: Lessons from Italy;The literature on municipal solid waste in relation to COVID-19 is scarce. Based on the experience of Italy, the present article contributes to the strategies aimed at preventing a second virus outbreak. In fact, the mismanagement of municipal solid waste could undermine the strategies during the ease of the lockdown. During the SARS-COV-2 outbreak in Italy, there was a general decrease in the selective collection rate (−15% in one municipality with a well-developed door-to-door collection system). Delays in the publication of guidelines on waste management impacted on the safety of the operators collecting potentially infected waste. Contrarily to expectations, single-use masks and gloves do not have significant impact on waste management, accounting for <1% of the residual municipal solid waste collected annually. However, the dispersion of abandoned masks and gloves outside indoor environments is creating environmental problems. Recommendations on waste management and the protection of waste operators are discussed. Finally, guidelines on the most appropriate waste treatment are presented and analyzed. The results presented in this article show that the MSW management sector has found useful solutions to tackle COVID-19
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection of hospital isolation wards hygiene monitoring during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak in a Chinese hospital;The aim of this paper was to monitor the presence of SARS-Cov-2 among hospital environment surfaces, sewage, and personal protective equipment (PPE) of staffs in isolation wards in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, China.
Potential spreading risks and disinfection challenges of medical wastewater by the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA in septic tanks of Fangcang Hospital;The outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia raises the concerns of effective deactivation of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in medical wastewater by disinfectants. In this study, we evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in septic tanks of Wuchang Cabin Hospital and found a striking high level of (0.5–18.7) × 10
SARS-CoV-2 detection, viral load and infectivity over the course of an infection;To summarise the evidence on the detection pattern and viral load of SARS-CoV-2 over the course of an infection (including any asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic phase), and the duration of infectivity.
Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 among patients in the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre primary care network: a cross-sectional study;There are few primary care studies of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre primary care network.
Potential fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2: Current evidence and implications for public health;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Hubei Province, China in December 2019 and has since become a global pandemic, with hundreds of thousands of cases and over 165 countries affected. Primary routes of transmission of the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are through respiratory droplets and close person-to-person contact. While information about other potential modes of transmission are relatively sparse, evidence supporting the possibility of a fecally mediated mode of transmission has been accumulating. Here, current knowledge on the potential for fecal transmission is briefly reviewed and the possible implications are discussed from a public health perspective.
Effect of a Previous History of Antiretroviral Treatment on Clinical Picture of Patients with Co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV: A Preliminary Study;We aimed to explore the effect of antiretroviral treatment (ART) history on clinical characteristics of patients with co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV.
Intra-abdominal hypertension as a trigger of “gut failure” in SARS-CoV-2 infection: Effect of open abdomen (OA) and negative pressure therapy (NPT) on respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) function;COVID-19 gastrointestinal manifestations could be attributed to SARS-CoV-2-induced small vessel thrombosis. OA with NPT treatment may have a role in optimization of bowel microcirculation and in the reduction of the endothelial and the systemic cytokine-related damage, improving also respiratory function.
Presence and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewaters and rivers;The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewaters has been demonstrated in many countries affected by this pandemic. Nevertheless, virus presence and infectivity in treated wastewaters, but also in the receiving water bodies are still poorly investigated. In this study, raw and treated samples from three wastewater treatment plants, and three river samples within the Milano Metropolitan Area, Italy, were surveyed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by means of real time RT-PCR and infectivity test on culture cells. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in raw, but not in treated wastewaters (four and two samples, respectively, sampled in two dates). The isolated virus genome was sequenced, and belonged to the strain most spread in Europe and similar to another found in the same region. RNA presence in raw wastewater samples decreased after eight days, probably following the epidemiological trend estimated for the area. Virus infectivity was always null, indicating the natural decay of viral pathogenicity in time from emission. Samples from receiving rivers (three sites, sampled in the same dates as wastewaters) showed in some cases a positivity to real time RT-PCR, probably due to non-treated, or inefficiently treated discharges, or to the combined sewage overflows. Nevertheless, also for rivers infectivity was null. Risks for public health should be limited, although a precautionary approach to risk assessment is here advocated, giving the preliminary nature of the presented data.
First detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in North America: A study in Louisiana, USA;We investigated the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in wastewater samples in southern Louisiana, USA. Untreated and treated wastewater samples were collected on five occasions over a four-month period from January to April 2020. The wastewater samples were concentrated via ultrafiltration (Method A), and an adsorption–elution method using electronegative membranes (Method B). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 2 out of 15 wastewater samples using two reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays (CDC N1 and N2). None of the secondary treated and final effluent samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in North America, including the USA. However, concentration methods and RT-qPCR assays need to be refined and validated to increase the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in wastewater.
Cluster infections play important roles in the rapid evolution of COVID-19 transmission: A systematic review;To summarise the major types of SARS-CoV-2 cluster infections worldwide through a comprehensive systematic review.
The pathogenesis and treatment of the `Cytokine Storm' in COVID-19;Cytokine storm is a general term applied to maladaptive cytokine release in response to infection and other stimuli. The pathogenesis is complex but includes loss of regulatory control of proinflammatory cytokine production, both at local and systemic levels. The disease progresses rapidly, and the mortality is high. Some evidence shows that, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, severe deterioration in some patients has been closely associated with dysregulated and excessive cytokine release. This article reviews what we know of the mechanism and treatment strategies of the COVID-19 virus-induced inflammatory storm in an attempt to provide some background to inform future guidance for clinical treatment.
Early transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa: An epidemiological and phylogenetic report;To investigate introduction and understand the early transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 in South-Africa, we formed the Network for Genomic Surveillance in South Africa (NGS-SA).
N-Acetylcysteine: A potential therapeutic agent for SARS-CoV-2;COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread across the globe. Predisposing factors such as age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and lowered immune function increase the risk of disease severity. T cell exhaustion, high viral load, and high levels of TNF-ɑ, IL1β, IL6, IL10 have been associated with severe SARS-CoV-2. Cytokine and antigen overstimulation are potentially responsible for poor humoral response to the virus. Lower cellular redox status, which leads to pro-inflammatory states mediated by TNF-ɑ is also potentially implicated. 
How is immunosuppressive status affecting children and adults in SARS-CoV-2 infection? A systematic review;SARS-CoV-2 infection has now a global resonance. Data on how COVID-19 is affecting immunocompromised patients are however few. With our study we aimed to systematically review the current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 cases in children and adults with immunosuppression, to evaluate outcomes in this special population.
Fast SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR in preheated nasopharyngeal swab samples;The gold-standard COVID-19 diagnosis relies on detecting SARS-CoV-2 using RNA purification and one-step retrotranscription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Based on the urgent need for high-throughput screening, we tested the performance of three alternative, simple and affordable protocols to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2, bypassing the long and tedious RNA extraction step and reducing the time to viral detection.
SARS-CoV-2 immunity: review and applications to phase 3 vaccine candidates;Understanding immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is crucial to understanding disease pathogenesis and the usefulness of bridge therapies, such as hyperimmune globulin and convalescent human plasma, and to developing vaccines, antivirals, and monoclonal antibodies. A mere 11 months ago, the canvas we call COVID-19 was blank. Scientists around the world have worked collaboratively to fill in this blank canvas. In this Review, we discuss what is currently known about human humoral and cellular immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and relate this knowledge to the COVID-19 vaccines currently in phase 3 clinical trials.
Airborne spread of infectious SARS-CoV-2: Moving forward using lessons from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV;Although an increasing body of data reports the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air, this does not correlate to the presence of infectious viruses, thus not evaluating the risk for airborne COVID-19. Hence there is a marked knowledge gap that requires urgent attention. Therefore, in this systematic review, viability/stability of airborne SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses is discussed.
The novel SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Possible environmental transmission, detection, persistence and fate during wastewater and water treatment;The contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for COVID-19 disease, has infected over 27 million people across the globe within a few months. While literature on SARS-CoV-2 indicates that its transmission may occur predominantly via aerosolization of virus-laden droplets, the possibility of alternate routes of transmission and/or reinfection via the environment requires considerable scientific attention. This review aims to collate information on possible transmission routes of this virus, to ascertain its fate in the environment. Concomitant with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in faeces and saliva of infected patients, studies also indicated its occurrence in raw wastewater, primary sludge and river water. Therefore sewerage system could be a possible route of virus outbreak, a possible tool to assess viral community spread and future surveillance technique. Hence, this review looked into detection, occurrence and fate of SARS-CoV-2 during primary, secondary, and tertiary wastewater and water treatment processes based on published literature on SARS-CoV and other enveloped viruses. The review also highlights the need for focused research on occurrence and fate of SARS-CoV-2 in various environmental matrices. Utilization of this information in environmental transmission models developed for other enveloped and enteric viruses can facilitate risk assessment studies. Preliminary research efforts with SARS-CoV-2 and established scientific reports on other coronaviruses indicate that the threat of virus transmission from the aquatic environment may be currently non-existent. However, the presence of viral RNA in wastewater provides an early warning that highlights the need for effective sewage treatment to prevent a future outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
First environmental surveillance for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water in Japan;Wastewater-based epidemiology is a powerful tool to understand the actual incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a community because severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19, can be shed in the feces of infected individuals regardless of their symptoms. The present study aimed to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, using four quantitative and two nested PCR assays. Influent and secondary-treated (before chlorination) wastewater samples and river water samples were collected five times from a wastewater treatment plant and three times from a river, respectively, between March 17 and May 7, 2020. The wastewater and river water samples (200–5000 mL) were processed by using two different methods: the electronegative membrane-vortex (EMV) method and the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. Based on the observed concentrations of indigenous pepper mild mottle virus RNA, the EMV method was found superior to the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was successfully detected in one of five secondary-treated wastewater samples with a concentration of 2.4 × 10
Environmental contamination by SARS-CoV-2 of an imported case during incubation period;We collected environmental surface samples prior to and after disinfection of a quarantine room to evaluate the stability of SARS-CoV-2 during the incubation period of an imported case traveling to Qingdao, China. Overall, 11 of 23 (47.8%) of the first batch of environmental surface samples (within 4 h after case confirmation) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Whereas only 2 of 23 (8.7%) of the second batch of environmental samples (after first disinfection) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The majority of samples from the bedroom (70%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, followed by 50% of samples from the bathroom and that of 33% from the corridor. The inner walls of toilet bowl and sewer inlet were the most contaminated sites with the highest viral loads. SARS-CoV-2 was widely distributed on object surfaces in a quarantine room of a later diagnosed COVID-19 case during the incubation period. Proper disinfection is crucial to minimize community transmission of this highly contagious virus.
A data-driven hypothesis on the epigenetic dysregulation of host metabolism by SARS coronaviral infection: Potential implications for the SARS-CoV-2 modus operandi;COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus structurally similar to SARS-CoV. Based on both structural and syndromic similarities with SARS-CoV, a hypothesis is formed on SARS-CoV-2 potential to affect the host’s metabolism as part of its lifecycle. This hypothesis is evaluated by (a) exploratory analysis of SARS-CoV/human transcriptomic interaction data and gene set enrichment analysis (b) a confirmatory, focused review of the literature based on the findings by (a). A STRING Viruses (available search for human – SARS-CoV (NCBI taxonomy Id: 9606 vs. NCBI taxonomy Id: 694009) genomic interactions reveals ten human proteins, interacting with SARS-CoV: SGTA, FGL2, SPECC1, STAT3, PHB, BCL2L1, PPP1CA, CAV1, JUN, XPO1. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) with STRING on this network revealed their role as a putative protein – protein interaction network (PPI
No SARS-CoV-2 detected in air samples (pollen and particulate matter) in Leipzig during the first spread;The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic co-occurred with pollen season in Europe 2020 and recent studies suggest a potential link between both. Air samples collected at our measuring station in Leipzig and purified pollen were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 typical signals or for virus-induced cytopathic effects, to test if the virus could bind to bioaerosols and if so, whether these complexes are infectious. The results show that neither our air samples nor purified pollen were infectious or could act as carrier for virus particles.
A physicochemical model for rationalizing SARS-CoV-2 concentration in sewage. Case study: The city of Thessaloniki in Greece;Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage has been employed by several researchers as an alternative early warning indicator of virus spreading in communities, covering both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. A factor that can seriously mislead the quantitative measurement of viral copies in sewage is the adsorption of virus fragments onto the highly porous solids suspended in wastewater, making them inaccessible. This depends not only on the available amount of suspended solids, but also on the amount of other dissolved chemicals which may influence the capacity of adsorption. On this account, the present work develops a mathematical framework, at various degrees of spatial complexity, of a physicochemical model that rationalizes the quantitative measurements of total virus fragments in sewage as regards the adsorption of virus onto suspended solids and the effect of dissolved chemicals on it. The city of Thessaloniki in Greece is employed as a convenient case study to determine the values of model variables. The present data indicate the ratio of the specific absorption (UV
Dynamic profile for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using four immunochromatographic assays;In order to fight the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic infection, there is a growing need and demand for diagnostic tools that are complementary and different from the RT-PCR currently in use. Multiple serological tests are or will be very soon available but need to be evaluated and validated. We have thus tested 4 immunochromatographic tests for the detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we assessed the kinetics of antibody appearance using these assays in 22 patients after they were tested positive by RT-PCR. We observed great heterogeneity in antibody detection post-symptom onset. The median antibody detection time was between 8 and 10 days according to the manufacturers. All the tests showed a sensitivity of 60 to 80% on day 10 and 100% on day 15. In addition, a single cross-reaction was observed with other human coronavirus infections. Thus, immunochromatographic tests for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may have their place for the diagnostic panel of COVID-19.
The hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 affects male reproductive ability by regulating autophagy;The outbreak of CoronaVirus Disease19 (COVID19) in December 2019 posed a serious threat to public safety, and its rapid spread caused a global health emergency. Clinical data show that in addition to respiratory system damage, some male patients with COVID-19 are also accompanied by abnormal renal function and even renal damage. As the main receptor of syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is also found to be highly expressed not only in respiratory mucosa and alveolar epithelial cells, but also in renal tubule cells, testicular Leydig cells and seminiferous tubule cells. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has the possibility of infecting the male reproductive system, and the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the patient's semen further confirms this theory. In previous studies, it has been found that ACE2 has the ability to regulate autophagy. Not only that, recent studies have also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection can also lead to a reduction in autophagy. All of these associate SARS-CoV-2 with autophagy. Furthermore, autophagy has been shown to have an effect on male reproduction in many studies. Based on these, we propose the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 affects male reproductive function by regulating autophagy. This hypothesis may provide a new idea for future treatment of COVID-19 male patients with reproductive function injury, and it can also prompt medical staff and patients to consciously check their reproductive function.
Comparison of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 detection in 353 patients received tests with both specimens simultaneously;Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan in December 2019, by March 10, 2020, a total of 80,932 confirmed cases have been reported in China. Two consecutively negative RT-PCR test results in respiratory tract specimens is required for the evaluation of discharge from hospital, and oropharyngeal swabs were the most common sample. However, false negative results occurred in the late stage of hospitalization, and avoiding false negative result is critical essential.
Wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2: Lessons learnt from recent studies to define future applications;Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is successful in the detection of the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This review examines the methods used and results of recent studies on the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. WBE becomes essential, especially with virus transmission path uncertainty, limitations on the number of clinical tests that could be conducted, and a relatively long period for infected people to show symptoms. Wastewater surveillance was used to show the effect of lockdown on the virus spread. A WBE framework tailored for SARS-CoV-2 that incorporates lessons learnt from the reviewed studies was developed. Results of the review helped outline challenges facing the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples. A comparison between the various studies with regards to sample concentration and virus quantification was conducted. Five different primers sets were used for qPCR quantification
Red blood cell exchange for SARS-CoV-2: A Gemini of therapeutic opportunities;As of now, therapeutic strategies for the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) are limited and much focus has been placed on social distancing techniques to “flatten the curve”. Initial treatment efforts including ventilation and hydroxychloroquine garnered significant controversy and today, SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are still occurring throughout the world. Needless to say, new therapeutic strategies are needed to combat this unprecedented pandemic. 
Why does SARS-CoV-2 survive longer on plastic than on paper?;The Covid-19 coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is inactivated much faster on paper (3h) than on plastic (7d). By classifying materials according to virus stability on their surface, the following list is obtained (from long to short stability): polypropylene (mask), plastic, glass, stainless steel, pig skin, cardboard, banknote, cotton, wood, paper, tissue, copper. These observations and other studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be inactivated by dryness on water absorbent porous materials but sheltered by long-persisting micro-droplets of water on waterproof surfaces. If such physical phenomenons were confirmed by direct evidence, the persistence of the virus on any surface could be predicted, and new porous objects could be designed to eliminate the virus faster.
Lack of antiviral activity of darunavir against SARS-CoV-2;Given the high need and the absence of specific antivirals for treatment of COVID-19 (the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors are being considered as therapeutic alternatives.
Increasing SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR testing capacity by sample pooling;Limited testing capacity has characterized the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, hampering a timely control of outbreaks and the possibilities to reduce the escalation of community transmissions. Here we investigated the potential of using pooling of samples followed by one-step retrotranscription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity.
Evolutionary analysis of SARS-CoV-2: how mutation of Non-Structural Protein 6 (NSP6) could affect viral autophagy;SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus that has spread globally, infecting more than 150000 people, and being declared pandemic by the WHO. We provide here bio-informatic, evolutionary analysis of 351 available sequences of its genome with the aim of mapping genome structural variations and the patterns of selection.
Sensitivity of different RT-qPCR solutions for SARS-CoV-2 detection;The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to impose demands on diagnostic screening. In anticipation that the recurrence of outbreaks and the measures for lifting the lockdown worldwide may cause supply chain issues over the coming months, this study assessed the sensitivity of a number of one-step retrotranscription and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) solutions to detect SARS-CoV-2.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on public surfaces in a densely populated urban area of Brazil: A potential tool for monitoring the circulation of infected patients;The world is experiencing the worst global health crisis in recent decades since December/2019 due to a new pandemic coronavirus. The COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in more than 30 million cases and 950 thousand deaths worldwide as of September 21, 2020. Determining the extent of the virus on public surfaces is critical for understanding the potential risk of infection in these areas. In this study, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on public surfaces in a densely populated urban area in Brazil. Forty-nine of 933 samples tested positive (5.25%) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including samples collected from distinct material surfaces, including metal and concrete, and distinct places, mainly around hospital care units and public squares. Our data indicated the contamination of public surfaces by SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the circulation of infected patients and the risk of infection for the population. Constant monitoring of the virus in urban areas is required as a strategy to fight the pandemic and prevent further infections.
Possible intrauterine SARS-CoV-2 infection: Positive nucleic acid testing results and consecutive positive SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels within 50 days after birth;Whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) affects the fetus in utero is important to the well-being of the mother and neonate. We report the case of a full-term neonate born to a mother who developed symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at 32 weeks of gestation. The placental pathology showed slight local inflammation. Serial quantitative antibody measurements in the neonate showed elevated levels of IgM on the day of birth and a gradual decline to negative levels within 28 days of life
Viral Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 over the preclinical, clinical, and postclinical period;It is necessary to know the viral kinetics and conduct epidemiologic investigations of confirmers to prevent the spread of the new infectious disease COVID-19 to the community. To date, no study has been published on viral kinetics during the preclinical and clinical periods of SARS-CoV-2.
First detection of SARS-CoV-2 in untreated wastewaters in Italy;Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of environmental surveillance through the monitoring of sewage for the assessment of viruses circulating in a given community (wastewater-based epidemiology, WBE).
Potential secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via wastewater;The new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has spread internationally and whilst the current focus of those dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic is understandably restricting its direct transmission, the potential for secondary transmission via wastewater should not be underestimated. The virus has been identified in human fecal and wastewater samples from different countries and potential cases of transmission via wastewater have been reported. Our recommendations for hospital wastewater treatment, municipal wastewater plants, sewage sludge, water reuse and aquatic environments are designed to reduce the risk of such transmission, and contribute to limiting the resurgence of COVID-19 as current restrictions are relaxed. A particular urgent recommendation focusses on supporting low-income countries in tackling the potential for secondary transmission via wastewater.
Inoculum at the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and risk of disease severity;A relationship between the infecting dose and the risk of disease severity has not been demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we report three clusters of individuals that were potentially exposed to distinct inoculum in Madrid. Overall each group developed divergent clinical forms of COVID-19. Our data support that a greater viral inoculum at the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure might determine a higher risk of severe COVID-19.
Quantifying the risk of indoor drainage system in multi-unit apartment building as a transmission route of SARS-CoV-2;The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on human society. The isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from patients' feces on human cell line raised concerns of possible transmission through human feces including exposure to aerosols generated by toilet flushing and through the indoor drainage system. Currently, routes of transmission, other than the close contact droplet transmission, are still not well understood. A quantitative microbial risk assessment was conducted to estimate the health risks associated with two aerosol exposure scenarios: 1) toilet flushing, and 2) faulty connection of a floor drain with the building's main sewer pipe. SARS-CoV-2 data were collected from the emerging literature. The infectivity of the virus in feces was estimated based on a range of assumption between viral genome equivalence and infectious unit. The human exposure dose was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation of viral concentrations in aerosols under each scenario and human breathing rates. The probability of COVID-19 illness was generated using the dose-response model for SARS-CoV-1, a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, that was responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2003. The results indicate the median risks of developing COVID-19 for a single day exposure is 1.11 × 10
SARS-CoV-2 has displaced other seasonal respiratory viruses: Results from a prospective cohort study;The effect of SARS-CoV-2 on existing respiratory viruses in circulation and the overall burden of viral respiratory disease remains uncertain. Traditionally, severe viral respiratory disease disproportionally affects those with underlying chronic lung diseases. This study aimed to assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the prevalence and clinical characteristics of respiratory virus disease in hospitalised adults.
SARS-CoV-2 infection does not induce HIV viral escape in the central nervous system: A case series;We report two cases of HIV positive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and a recent diagnosis of opportunistic infections of central nervous system (CNS). We investigated the potential impact of coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 on HIV replication in CNS.
SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater: State of the knowledge and research needs;The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, which was officially declared by the World Health Organization. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family 
SARS-CoV-2 in the environment: Modes of transmission, early detection and potential role of pollutions;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading globally having a profound effect on lives of millions of people, causing worldwide economic disruption. Curbing the spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics may be accomplished through understanding the environmental context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and adoption of effective detection tools and mitigation policies. This article aims to examine the latest investigations on SARS-CoV-2 plausible environmental transmission modes, employment of wastewater surveillance for early detection of COVID-19, and elucidating the role of solid waste, water, and atmospheric quality on viral infectivity. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via faecal-oral or bio-aerosols lacks robust evidence and remains debatable. However, improper disinfection and defected plumbing systems in indoor environments such as hospitals and high-rise towers may facilitate the transport of virus-laden droplets of wastewater causing infection. Clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to present robust evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible via aerosols, though quantification of virus-laden aerosols at low concentrations presents a challenge. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can be an effective tool in early detection of outbreak and determination of COVID-19 prevalence within a population, complementing clinical testing and providing decision makers guidance on restricting or relaxing movement. While poor air quality increases susceptibility to diseases, evidence for air pollution impact on COVID-19 infectivity is not available as infections are dynamically changing worldwide. Solid waste generated by households with infected individuals during the lockdown period may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 via fomite transmission route but has received little attention from the scientific community. Water bodies receiving raw sewage may pose risk of infection but this has not been investigated to date. Overall, our understanding of the environmental perspective of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to detecting outbreak and predicting pandemic severity, allowing us to be equipped with the right tools to curb any future pandemic.
A chronicle of SARS-CoV-2: Part-I - Epidemiology, diagnosis, prognosis, transmission and treatment;In order to benefit the public, community workers and scientific community, we hereby present a chronicle of SARS-CoV-2 that leads to the unseen precedent of social distancing and lockdown owing to coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Information on this life-threatening pandemic of COVID-19 is sparse and discrete
SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and transmission risk factors among high-risk close contacts: a retrospective cohort study;The proportion of asymptomatic carriers and transmission risk factors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among household and non-household contacts remains unclear. In Singapore, extensive contact tracing by the Ministry of Health for every diagnosed COVID-19 case, and legally enforced quarantine and intensive health surveillance of close contacts provided a rare opportunity to determine asymptomatic attack rates and SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk factors among community close contacts of patients with COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 from faeces to wastewater treatment: What do we know? A review;SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been found in the faeces of infected patients in numerous studies. Stool may remain positive for SARS-CoV-2, even when the respiratory tract becomes negative, and the interaction with the gastrointestinal tract poses a series of questions about wastewater and its treatments. This review aims to understand the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces and sewage and its fate in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).
The duration of infectiousness of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2;To summarise the evidence on the duration of infectiousness of individuals in whom SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid is detected.
Pandemic danger to the deep: The risk of marine mammals contracting SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater;We are in unprecedented times with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has impacted public health, the economy and our society on a global scale. In addition, the impacts of COVID-19 permeate into our environment and wildlife as well. Here, we discuss the essential role of wastewater treatment and management during these times. A consequence of poor wastewater management is the discharge of untreated wastewater carrying infectious SARS-CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home to marine mammals. Here, we predict the susceptibility of marine mammal species using a modelling approach. We identified that many species of whale, dolphin and seal, as well as otters, are predicted to be highly susceptible to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, geo-mapping highlights how current wastewater management in Alaska may lead to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to the virus. Localities such as Cold Bay, Naknek, Dillingham and Palmer may require additional treatment of their wastewater to prevent virus spillover through sewage. Since over half of these susceptibility species are already at risk worldwide, the release of the virus via untreated wastewater could have devastating consequences for their already declining populations. For these reasons, we discuss approaches that can be taken by the public, policymakers and wastewater treatment facilities to reduce the risk of virus spillover in our natural water systems. Thus, we indicate the potential for reverse zoonotic transmission of COVID-19 and its impact on marine wildlife
Evaluation of a novel antigen-based rapid detection test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples;In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the development and validation of rapid and easy-to-perform diagnostic methods are of high priority. This study was performed to evaluate a novel rapid antigen detection test (RDT) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in respiratory samples.
Genomic evidence for reinfection with SARS-CoV-2: a case study;The degree of protective immunity conferred by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently unknown. As such, the possibility of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood. We describe an investigation of two instances of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same individual.
Linking ACE2 and angiotensin II to pulmonary immunovascular dysregulation in SARS-CoV-2 infection;Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. ACE2 has been shown to be down-regulated during coronaviral infection, with implications for circulatory homeostasis. In COVID-19, pulmonary vascular dysregulation has been observed resulting in ventilation perfusion mismatches in lung tissue, causing profound hypoxemia. Despite the loss of ACE2 and raised circulating vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (AngII), COVID-19 patients experience a vasodilative vasculopathy. This article discusses the interplay between the immune system and pulmonary vasculature and how SARS-CoV-2-mediated ACE2 disruption and AngII may contribute to the novel vascular pathophysiology of COVID-19.
Quantifying the improvement in confirmation efficiency of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the early phase of the outbreak in Hong Kong in 2020;The emerging virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused a large outbreak of coronavirus disease, COVID-19, in Wuhan, China, since December 2019. COVID-19 soon spread to other regions of China and overseas. In Hong Kong, local mitigation measures were implemented since the first imported case was confirmed on January 23, 2020. Here we evaluated the temporal variation of detection delay from symptoms onset to laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong.
Performance characteristics of five immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2: a head-to-head benchmark comparison;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic in 2020. Testing is crucial for mitigating public health and economic effects. Serology is considered key to population-level surveillance and potentially individual-level risk assessment. However, immunoassay performance has not been compared on large, identical sample sets. We aimed to investigate the performance of four high-throughput commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassays and a novel 384-well ELISA.
The temporal association of introducing and lifting non-pharmaceutical interventions with the time-varying reproduction number (;Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented by many countries to reduce the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of COVID-19. A resurgence in COVID-19 cases has been reported in some countries that lifted some of these NPIs. We aimed to understand the association of introducing and lifting NPIs with the level of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as measured by the time-varying reproduction number (
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak: What we know;There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019
The incidence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic patients: A systematic review;The recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread globally since its discovery in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. A comprehensive strategy – including surveillance, diagnostics, research, and clinical treatment – is urgently needed to win the battle against COVID-19. Recently, numerous studies have reported the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients. Yet, the incidence and viral transmission from the asymptomatic cases are not yet apparent.
Specific ACE2 expression in small intestinal enterocytes may cause gastrointestinal symptoms and injury after 2019-nCoV infection;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread in other countries in December 2019. The infected patients presented with fever, respiratory symptoms, sometimes with digestive and other systemic manifestations, and some progressed with a severe acute respiratory syndrome or even death. Associated digestive symptoms were frequently observed in the patients, with an unknown significance and mechanism. ACE2, as the major known functional receptor of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) attracted our attention. We collected the clinical data of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients from published studies and extracted the data about the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, we used online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs, especially in the small intestine, to explore the relationship between ACE2 expression patterns and clinical symptoms. We found that diarrhea accounted for a notable proportion of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 8.0% to 12.9%. The results reveal that ACE2 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the small intestinal enterocytes but not in the goblet cells or intestinal immune cells. High expression of ACE2 on the surface cells in the digestive tract may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation susceptibility. Overall, digestive symptoms were common in the COVID-19 patients. ACE2 expression on surface cells of the small intestine may mediate the invasion and amplification of the virus and activation of gastrointestinal inflammation. It is a possible mechanism of digestive symptoms in the COVID-19 patients and explains the presence of the virus in patients’ stool samples. The study also highlights the necessity of taking stool samples for suspected patients to help in early diagnosis and assessment of disease status.
High prevalence of pre-existing serological cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in sub-Sahara Africa;Significant morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 has been experienced in America, Europe and Asia
Is the oral cavity a reservoir for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding?;Limited knowledge about the contagiosity and case fatality rate of COVID-19 as well as the still enigmatic route of transmission have led to strict limitations of non-emergency health care especially in head and neck medicine and dentistry. There are theories that the oral cavity provides a favorable environment for SARS-CoV-2 entry and persistence which may be a risk for prolonged virus shedding. However, intraoral innate immune mechanisms provide antiviral effects against a myriad of pathogenic viruses. Initial hints of their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 are surfacing. It is hypothesized that intraoral immune system activity modulates the invasion pattern of SARS-CoV-2 into oral cells. Thus, the significance of intraoral tissues for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and persistence cannot be assessed.
Analysis of the potential impact of genomic variants in global SARS-CoV-2 genomes on molecular diagnostic assays;An epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus diseases (C0VID-19) initially reported in Wuhan, China has rapidly emerged into a global pandemic affecting millions of people worldwide. Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) forms the mainstay in screening, diagnosis and epidemiology of the disease. Since the virus evolves by accumulating base substitutions, mutations in the viral genome could possibly affect the accuracy of RT-PCR-based detection assays. The recent availability of genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates motivated us to assess the presence and potential impact of variations in target sites of the oligonucleotide primers and probes used in molecular diagnosis. We catalogued a total of 132 primer or probe sequences from literature and data available in the public domain. Our analysis revealed that a total of 5,862 unique genetic variants mapped to at least one of the 132 primer or probe binding sites in the genome. A total of 29 unique variants were present in ≥ 1% of genomes from at least one of the continents (Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America) that mapped to 36 unique primers or probes binding sites. Similarly, a total of 27 primer or probe binding sites had cumulative variants frequency of ≥ 1% in the global SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These included primers or probes sites which are used worldwide for molecular diagnosis as well as approved by national and international agencies. We also found 286 SARS-CoV-2 genomic regions with low variability at a continuous stretch of ≥ 20bps that could be potentially used for primer designing. This highlights the need for sequencing genomes of emerging pathogens to enable evidence-based policies for development and approval of diagnostics.
A field indoor air measurement of SARS-CoV-2 in the patient rooms of the largest hospital in Iran;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city, China, in late 2019 and has rapidly spread throughout the world. The major route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is in contention, with the airborne route a likely transmission pathway for carrying the virus within indoor environments. Until now, there has been no evidence for detection of airborne severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this may have implication for the potential spread of the COVID-19. We investigated the air of patient rooms with confirmed COVID-19 in the largest hospital in Iran, on March 17, 2020. To collect the SARS-CoV-2 particles, ten air samples were collected into the sterile standard midget impingers containing 20 mL DMEM with 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin and 1% antifoam reagent for 1 h. Besides, indoor particle number concentrations, CO
SARS-CoV-2 in river water: Implications in low sanitation countries;Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic studies on viral shedding have reported that this virus is excreted in feces in most patients. High viral loads are found at the sewage pipeline or at the entrance of wastewater treatment plants from cities where the number of COVID-19 cases are significant. In Quito (Ecuador) as in many other cities worldwide, wastewater is directly discharged into natural waters. The aim of this study was to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 presence in urban streams from a low sanitation context. Three river locations along the urban rivers of Quito were sampled on the 5th of June during a peak of COVID-19 cases. River samples were evaluated for water quality parameters and afterwards, concentrated for viral analysis using skimmed milk flocculation method. The viral concentrates were quantified for SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2 target regions) and Human Adenovirus as a human viral indicator. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected for both target regions in all samples analyzed in a range of 2,91E+05 to 3,19E+06 GC/L for N1 and from 2,07E+05 to 2,22E+06 GC/L for N2. The high values detected in natural waters from a low sanitation region have several implications in health and ecology that should be further assessed.
Effect of Environmental Pollutants PM-2.5, Carbon Monoxide, and Ozone on the Incidence and Mortality of SARS-COV-2 Infection in Wildfire Affected Ten Counties in California;Various regions of California have experienced a large number of wildfires this year, at the same time the state has been experiencing a large number of cases of and deaths from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The present study aimed to investigate the relationship of wildfire allied pollutants, including particulate matter (PM-2.5μm), carbon monoxide (CO), and Ozone (O
Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in the environment: Occurrence, persistence, analysis in aquatic systems and possible management;The year 2020 brought the news of the emergence of a new respiratory disease (COVID-19) from Wuhan, China. The disease is now a global pandemic and is caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2 by international bodies. Important viral transmission sources include human contact, respiratory droplets and aerosols, and through contact with contaminated objects. However, viral shedding in feces and urine by COVID-19-afflicted patients raises concerns about SARS-CoV-2 entering aquatic systems. Recently, targeted SARS-CoV-2 genome fragments have been successfully detected in wastewater, sewage sludge and river waters around the world. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) studies can provide early detection and assessment of COVID-19 transmission and the growth of active cases within given wastewater catchment areas. WBE surveillance's ability to detect the growth of cases was demonstrated. Was this science applied throughout the world as this pandemic spread throughout the globe? Wastewater treatment efficacy for SARS-CoV-2 removal and risk assessments associated with treated water are reported. Disinfection strategies using chemical disinfectants, heat and radiation for deactivating and destroying SARS-CoV-2 are explained. Analytical methods of SARS-CoV-2 detection are covered. This review provides a more complete overview of the present status of SARS-CoV-2 and its consequences in aquatic systems. So far, WBE programs have not yet served to provide the early alerts to authorities that they have the potential to achieve. This would be desirable in order to activate broad public health measures at earlier stages of local and regional stages of transmission.
Evaluation Of Viral Concentration Methods For Sars-Cov-2 Recovery From Wastewaters;Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a useful tool that has the potential to act as a complementary approach to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and as an early alarm system for COVID-19 outbreak. Many studies reported low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage and also revealed the need for methodological validation for enveloped viruses concentration in wastewater. The aim of this study was to evaluate different methodologies for the concentration of viruses in wastewaters and to select and improve an option that maximizes the recovery of SARS-CoV-2. A total of 11 concentration techniques based on different principles were evaluated: adsorption-elution protocols with negatively charged membranes followed by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation (Methods 1-2), PEG precipitation (Methods 3-7), aluminum polychloride (PAC) flocculation (Method 8), ultrafiltration (Method 9), skim milk flocculation (Method 10) and adsorption-elution with negatively charged membrane followed by ultrafiltration (Method 11). To evaluate the performance of these concentration techniques, feline calicivirus (FCV) was used as a process control in order to avoid the risk associated with handling SARS-CoV-2. Two protocols, one based on PEG precipitation and the other on PAC flocculation, showed high efficiency for FCV recovery from wastewater (62.2 % and 45.0 %, respectively). These two methods were then tested for the specific recovery of SARS-CoV-2. Both techniques could recover SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater, PAC flocculation showed a lower limit of detection (4.3 × 10
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using commercial assays and seroconversion patterns in hospitalized patients;SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays are needed for serological surveys and as a complement to molecular tests to confirm COVID-19. However, the kinetics of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly described and relies on the performance of the different serological tests.
Comparison of automated SARS-CoV-2 antigen test for COVID-19 infection with quantitative RT-PCR using 313 nasopharyngeal swabs, including from seven serially followed patients;In routine clinical practice, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is determined by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR). In the current pandemic, a more rapid and high-throughput method is in growing demand. Here, we validated the performance of a new antigen test (LUMIPULSE) based on chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay. A total of 313 nasopharyngeal swabs (82 serial samples from 7 infected patients and 231 individual samples from 4 infected patients and 215 uninfected individuals) were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 with quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and then subjected to LUMIPULSE. We determined the cutoff value for antigen detection using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and compared the performance of the antigen test with that of RT-qPCR. We also compared the viral loads and antigen levels in serial samples from seven infected patients. Using RT-qPCR as the reference, the antigen test exhibited 55.2% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity, with a 91.4% overall agreement rate (286/313). In specimens with > 100 viral copies and between 10 and 100 copies, the antigen test showed 100% and 85% concordance with RT-qPCR, respectively. This concordance declined with lower viral loads. In the serially followed patients, the antigen levels showed a steady decline, along with viral clearance. This gradual decline was in contrast with the abrupt positive-to-negative and negative-to-positive status changes observed with RT-qPCR, particularly in the late phase of infection. In summary, the LUMIPULSE antigen test can rapidly identify SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with moderate to high viral loads and may be helpful for monitoring viral clearance in hospitalized patients.
A case of transient existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the respiratory tract with the absence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response;We report the case of a patient who had travelled to Japan and who presented mild respiratory symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak period. There was transient existence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in his oropharynx. The RNA was absent in the six respiratory specimens that were subsequently tested. An anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response was absent in the acute and convalescent sera. The reported case indicates that transient colonization of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract is possible without inciting any antibody response against the virus.
COVID-19: Can the symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection affect the homeostasis of the gut-brain-microbiota axis?;COVID-19 is associated with acute and lethal pneumonia, causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is not confined to the respiratory tract, as demonstrated by clinical evidence of the involvement of multiple organs, including the central nervous system (CNS). In this context, we hypothesized that both oligosymptomatic and symptomatic patients present an imbalance in the microbiota-gut (immune system) and nervous system axis, worsening the clinical picture. The brain constantly receives a direct and indirect influence from the intestine, more specifically from the immune system and intestinal microbiota. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the intestine and CNS, can contribute to both neurological disorders and gut immune system imbalance, events potentialized by an intestinal microbiota dysbiosis, aggravating the patient’s condition and causing more prolonged harmful effects.
Physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection to prevent person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 and is spread person-to-person through close contact. We aimed to investigate the effects of physical distance, face masks, and eye protection on virus transmission in health-care and non-health-care (eg, community) settings.
First confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 in untreated wastewater in Australia: A proof of concept for the wastewater surveillance of COVID-19 in the community;Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is accompanied by the shedding of the virus in stool. Therefore, the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater affords the ability to monitor the prevalence of infections among the population via wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). In the current work, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater in a catchment in Australia and viral RNA copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) resulting in two positive detections within a six day period from the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The estimated viral RNA copy numbers observed in the wastewater were then used to estimate the number of infected individuals in the catchment via Monte Carlo simulation. Given the uncertainty and variation in the input parameters, the model estimated a median range of 171 to 1,090 infected persons in the catchment, which is in reasonable agreement with clinical observations. This work highlights the viability of WBE for monitoring infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in communities. The work also draws attention to the need for further methodological and molecular assay validation for enveloped viruses in wastewater.
Minimization of spreading of SARS-CoV-2 via household waste produced by subjects affected by COVID-19 or in quarantine;Currently available evidence supports that the predominant route of human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 is through respiratory droplets. Indirect hands contact with surfaces contaminated by infectious droplets subsequently touching the mouth, nose or eyes seems to be another route of an indirect contact transmission. Persistence of the virus on different surfaces and other materials has been reported in recent studies: SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard. Viable virus was detected up to 72 h after application to different surfaces, although infectivity decay was also observed. This evidence suggests the likelihood that waste generated from patients affected by COVID-19 or subjects in quarantine treated in private houses or in areas different from hospitals and medical centres could be contaminated by SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, waste streams may represent a route for viral spreading being a potential risk also for the operators directly involved in the different phases of waste management. To address this concern, a specific multidisciplinary working group was settled by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) during the COVID-19 emergency, in order to establish guidelines related to solid waste collection, delivering, withdrawal, transport, treatment and disposal. Temporary stop of waste sorting, instructions for the population on how to package waste, instructions for Companies and operators for the adoption of adequate personal protection equipment (PPE), the use and sanitation of proper vehicles were among the main recommendations provided to the community by publications of freely downloadable reports and infographics in layman language. Incineration, sterilization and properly managed landfills were identified as the facilities to be preferentially adopted for the treatment of this kind of waste, considering the main inactivation strategies of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. treatment length > 9 days and temperature > 70 °C for more than 5 min).
SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical features and outcome of COVID-19 in United Kingdom nursing homes;To understand SARS-Co-V-2 infection and transmission in UK nursing homes in order to develop preventive strategies for protecting the frail elderly residents.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in the air and on surfaces in the COVID-19 ward of a hospital in Milan, Italy;The COVID-19 outbreak has rapidly progressed worldwide finding the health system, scientists and society unprepared to face a little-known, fast spreading, and extremely deadly virus. Italy is one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic, resulting in healthcare facilities bearing heavy burdens and severe restrictive measures. Despite efforts to clarify the virus transmission, especially in indoor scenarios, several aspects of SARS-CoV-2 spread are still rudimentary. This study evaluated the contamination of the air and surfaces by SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the COVID-19 isolation ward of a hospital in Milan, Italy. A total of 42 air and surface samples were collected inside five different zones of the ward including contaminated (COVID-19 patients' area), semi-contaminated (undressing room), and clean areas. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was performed using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Overall, 24.3% of swab samples were positive, but none of these were collected in the clean area. Thus, the positivity rate was higher in contaminated (35.0%) and semi-contaminated (50.0%) areas than in clean areas (0.0%
Apparent difference in fatalities between Central Europe and East Asia due to SARS-COV-2 and COVID-19: Four hypotheses for possible explanation;The comparison of the numbers of cases and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 shows that people in Central Europe are much more affected than people in East Asia where the disease originally occurred. Trying to explain this difference, this communication presents four hypotheses that propose the following reasons for the observed findings: 1) Differences in social behaviors and cultures of people in the two regions
Multiple assays in a real-time RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 panel can mitigate the risk of loss of sensitivity by new genomic variants during the COVID-19 outbreak;In this study, five SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay panels were evaluated against the accumulated genetic variability of the virus to assess the effect on sensitivity of the individual assays.
Isolation and phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants collected in Russia during the COVID-19 outbreak;The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in December 2019 in China and then spread worldwide over the following months, involving 188 countries. The objective of this study was to determine the molecular epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak in Russia.
Could sudden sensorineural hearing loss be the sole manifestation of COVID-19? An investigation into SARS-COV-2 in the etiology of sudden sensorineural hearing loss;This study aimed to investigate the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients presenting with only sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHNL) during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mortality in COVID-19 disease patients: Correlating the association of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) with severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants;Genetic factors such as the HLA type of patients may play a role in regard to disease severity and clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19. Taking the data deposited in the GISAID database, we made predictions using the IEDB analysis resource (TepiTool) to gauge how variants in the SARS-CoV-2 genome may change peptide binding to the most frequent MHC-class I and -II alleles in Africa, Asia and Europe. We caracterized how a single mutation in the wildtype sequence of of SARS-CoV-2 could influence the peptide binding of SARS-CoV-2 variants to MHC class II, but not to MHC class I alleles. Assuming the ORF8 (L84S) mutation is biologically significant, selective pressure from MHC class II alleles may select for viral varients and subsequently shape the quality and quantity of cellular immune responses aginast SARS-CoV-2. MHC 4-digit typing along with viral sequence analysis should be considered in studies examining clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19.
Patients with COVID-19 and neurological manifestations show undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in the cerebrospinal fluid;We report that patients with COVID-19 displaying distinct neurological disorders have undetectable or extremely low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, indicating that viral clearance precede the neurological involvement. This finding points to the need for the development of more sensitive molecular tests and the investigation of other neurotropic pathogens to exclude concurrent neuroinfection.
Relevance of SARS-CoV-2 related factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expressions in gastrointestinal tissue with pathogenesis of digestive symptoms, diabetes-associated mortality, and disease recurrence in COVID-19 patients;COVID-19 is caused by a new strain of coronavirus called SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a positive sense single strand RNA virus. In humans, it binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with the help a structural protein on its surface called the S-spike. Further, cleavage of the viral spike protein (S) by the proteases like transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) or Cathepsin L (CTSL) is essential to effectuate host cell membrane fusion and virus infectivity. COVID-19 poses intriguing issues with imperative relevance to clinicians. The pathogenesis of GI symptoms, diabetes-associated mortality, and disease recurrence in COVID-19 are of particular relevance because they cannot be sufficiently explained from the existing knowledge of the viral diseases. Tissue specific variations of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry related receptors expression in healthy individuals can help in understanding the pathophysiological basis the aforementioned collection of symptoms.
Snowballing transmission of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) through wastewater: Any sustainable preventive measures to curtail the scourge in low-income countries?;In this communication, we proposed sustainable preventive measures that may be adopted by the low-income countries to forestall the potential outbreak and transmission of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) through wastewater. Most low-income countries have poor sanitation and wastewater management policies, which create potential risks of COVID 19 spread. Hence, the proposed measures include decentralization of wastewater treatment facilities, community-wide monitoring and testing of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples, improved sanitation, developing point-of-use devices for wastewater decontamination, and more focused policy interventions. Therefore, this paper adds useful insights into the monitoring and management of ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in low-income countries.
Persistence of intestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with COVID-19 leads to re-admission after pneumonia resolved;The current reports of COVID-19 focus on the respiratory system, however, intestinal infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 are also worthy of attention. This paper reported persistence of intestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to re-admission after pneumonia resolved in three cases with COVID-19.
Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in 104 people with SARS-CoV-2 infection on the ;The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat. Identification of markers for symptom onset and disease progression is a pressing issue. We described the clinical features of people infected on board the 
SARS-CoV-2 clearance in COVID-19 patients with Novaferon treatment: A randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial;The antiviral effects of Novaferon, a potent antiviral protein drug, on COVID-19 was evaluated in the laboratory, and in a randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial.
SARS-CoV-2 in hospital wastewater during outbreak of COVID-19: A review on detection, survival and disinfection technologies;Currently, the apparition of new SARS-CoV, known as SARS-CoV-2, affected more than 34 million people and causing high death rates worldwide. Recently, several studies reported SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in hospital wastewater. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted between humans via respiratory droplets, close contact and fomites. Fecal-oral transmission is considered also as a potential route of transmission since several scientists confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces of infected patients, therefore its transmission via feces in aquatic environment, particularly hospital wastewater. Hospitals are one of the important classes of polluting sectors around the world. It was identified that hospital wastewater contains hazardous elements and a wide variety of microbial pathogens and viruses. Therefore, this may potentially pose a significant risk of public health and environment infection.
Clinical characteristics, symptoms and outcomes of 1054 adults presenting to hospital with suspected COVID-19: A comparison of patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection;Most reports describing the characteristics of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 lack a comparator group. We compared clinical characteristics, symptoms, and outcomes of adults presenting to hospital during the pandemic first wave, who tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2.
Increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in staff working across different care homes: enhanced CoVID-19 outbreak investigations in London care Homes;Care homes have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to suffer large outbreaks even when community infection rates are declining, thus representing important pockets of transmission. We assessed occupational risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among staff in six care homes experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak during the peak of the pandemic in London, England.
Alveolar epithelial cell type II could be the main target of SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 development via NF-Kb pathway deregulation: a physio-pathological theory;The Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires a rapid solution and global collaborative efforts in order to define preventive and treatment strategies. One of the major challenges of this disease is the high number of patients needing advanced respiratory support due to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as the lung is the major –although not exclusive- target of the virus. The molecular mechanisms, pathogenic drivers and the target cell type(s) in SARS-CoV-2 infection are still poorly understood, but the development of a “hyperactive” immune response is proposed to play a role in the evolution of the disease and it is envisioned as a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Here we propose a theory by which the main targets for SARS-CoV-2 are the Type II Alveolar Epithelial Cells and the clinical manifestations of the syndrome are a direct consequence of their involvement. We propose the existence of a vicious cycle by which once alveolar damage starts in AEC II cells, the inflammatory state is supported by macrophage pro-inflammatory polarization (M1), cytokines release and by the activation of the NF-κB pathway. If this theory is confirmed, future therapeutic efforts can be directed to target Type 2 alveolar cells and the molecular pathogenic drivers associated with their dysfunction with currently available therapeutic strategies.
Expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and proteases in COVID-19 patients: A potential role of cellular FURIN in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2;Recently, a mini-review was published in the Medical Hypotheses journal by Usul Afsar entitled 2019-nCoV-SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection: Cruciality of Furin and relevance with cancer. Previous studies have pointed out that disruption of the proteolytic cleavage of proteins can promote infectious and non-infectious diseases. The last few weeks have been marked by an important revelation concerning the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2. This new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious and transmissible acute respiratory infectious disorder. SARS-CoV-2 is composed of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and structural proteins including Spike protein (S protein). Interestingly, the FURIN, one of the proproteins of the convertase family, plays a crucial role in the maturation of viral glycoproteins. In addition, many viruses including coronaviruses, exploit FURIN for the activation of their glycoproteins. Recent data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Subsequently, the S protein is cleaved by transmembrane protease serine 2 with the help of FURIN which facilitates the entry of the virus into the cell after binding. Furthermore, it seems that FURIN is implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and potentially in the increased rates of human-to-human transmission.
Clinical and epidemiological features discriminating confirmed COVID-19 patients from SARS-CoV-2 negative patients at screening centres in Madagascar;Early and fast detection of COVID-19 patients help limit the transmission and the widespread of the virus in the community and will have impact on mortality by reducing the incidence of infection among vulnerable people. Therefore, community-based screening is critical. We aimed to identify clinical signs and symptoms and epidemiological features that could help discriminate confirmed cases of COVID-19 from SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. We found that age (aOR:1.02, 95%CI:1.02-1.03, p < 0.001), symptoms onset between 3 and 14 days (aOR:1.35, 95%CI:1.09)1.68, p = 0.006), fever or history of fever (aOR:1.75, 95%CI:1.42-2.14, p < 0.001), cough (aOR:1.68, 95%CI:1.31-2.04), sore throat (aOR:0.65, 95%CI:0.49-0.85, p = 0.002), ageusia (aOR:2.24, 95%CI:1.42-3.54, p = 0.001), anosmia (aOR:6.04, 95%CI:4.19-8.69, p < 0.001), chest pain (aOR:0.63, 95%CI:0.47-0.85, p = 0.003), myalgia and/or arthralgia (aOR:1.64, 95%CI:1.31-2.04, p < 0.001), household cluster (aOR:1.49, 95%CI:1.17-1.91, p = 0.001) and evidence of confirmed cases in the neighbourhood (aOR:1.92, 95%CI:1.56-2.37, p < 0.001) could help discriminate COVID-19 patients from SARS-CoV-2 negative. A screening score derived from multivariate logistic regression was developed to assess the probability of COVID-19 in patients. We suggest that a patient with a score ≥ 14 should undergo SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. A patient with a score ≥ 30 should be considered at high risk of COVID-19 and should undergo testing but also need prompt isolation and contact tracing.
Evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: A global health emergency;According to data compiled by researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, more than two and half million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a newly discovered virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been confirmed on April 20, 2020 (Nature, 2020b). Since the emergence of this infectious disease in Asia (Wuhan, China) late last year, it has been subsequently span to every continent of the world except Antarctica (Rodríguez-Morales et al., 2020). Along with a foothold in every country, the current disease pandemic is disrupting practically every aspect of life all over the world. As the outbreak are continuing to evolve, several research activities have been conducted for better understanding the origin, functions, treatments, and preventions of this novel coronavirus. This review will be a summa of the key features of novel coronavirus (nCoV), the virus causing disease 2019 and the present epidemic situation worldwide up to April 20, 2020. It is expected that this record will play an important role to take more preventive measures for overcoming the challenges faced during this current pandemic.
First proof of the capability of wastewater surveillance for COVID-19 in India through detection of genetic material of SARS-CoV-2;We made the first ever successful effort in India to detect the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 viruses to understand the capability and application of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) surveillance in India. Sampling was carried out on 8 and 27 May 2020 at the Old Pirana Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) at Ahmedabad, Gujarat that receives effluent from Civil Hospital treating COVID-19 patients. All three, i.e. ORF1ab, N and S genes of SARS-CoV-2, were found in the influent with no genes detected in effluent collected on 8 and 27 May 2020. Increase in SARS-CoV-2 genetic loading in the wastewater between 8 and 27 May 2020 samples concurred with corresponding increase in the number of active COVID-19 patients in the city. The number of gene copies was comparable to that reported in untreated wastewaters of Australia, China and Turkey and lower than that of the USA, France and Spain. However, temporal changes in SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations need to be substantiated further from the perspectives of daily and short-term changes of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater through long-term monitoring. The study results SARS-CoV-2 will assist concerned authorities and policymakers to formulate and/or upgrade COVID-19 surveillance to have a more explicit picture of the pandemic curve. While infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 through the excreted viral genetic material in the aquatic environment is still being debated, the presence and detection of genes in wastewater systems makes a strong case for the environmental surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection and persistence in wastewater samples: An experimental network for COVID-19 environmental surveillance in Padua, Veneto Region (NE Italy);Clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stools supports the idea of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a precious tool for COVID-19 environmental surveillance. Successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in untreated wastewaters has been reported in several countries. This study investigated the presence and persistence of viral RNA in treated and untreated wastewaters in Padua, Italy. An urban experimental network of sampling sites was tested for prospective surveillance activities.
SARS-CoV-2 cell entry receptor ACE2 mediated endothelial dysfunction leads to vascular thrombosis in COVID-19 patients;Several studies have described unusually high incidence of vascular thrombosis in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients. Pathogenesis of the vascular thrombosis in COVID-19 is least understood for now and presents a challenge to the treating physicians. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen for COVID-19, has been shown to bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein in human epithelial cells which facilitates its entry in the organ and mediate tissue specific pathogenesis. For ACE2 mediated cell entry of the SARS-CoV-2, co-expression of one more protein—Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential. Existing studies suggested significant expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human vascular endothelium. Vascular endothelial dysfunction can potentially activate coagulation cascade eventually resulting in thrombosis. ACE2 has proven role in the maintenance of endothelial integrity inside the vessels. Existing 
Viable SARS-CoV-2 in the air of a hospital room with COVID-19 patients;Because the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols but failure to isolate viable (infectious) virus are commonly reported, there is substantial controversy whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be transmitted through aerosols. This conundrum occurs because common air samplers can inactivate virions through their harsh collection processes. We sought to resolve the question whether viable SARS-CoV-2 can occur in aerosols using VIVAS air samplers that operate on a gentle water vapor condensation principle.
First COVID-19 Case in Zambia – Comparative phylogenomic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 detected in African countries;Since its first discovery in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has spread rapidly worldwide. Whilst African countries were relatively spared initially, the initial low incidence of COVID-19 cases was not sustained for long due to continuing travel links between China, Europe and Africa.. In preparation, Zambia had applied a multisectoral national epidemic disease surveillance and response system resulting in the identification of the first case within 48 hours of the individual entering the country by air travel from a trip to France. Contact tracing showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was contained within the patient’s household, with no further spread to attending health care workers or community members. Phylogenomic analysis of the patient’s SARS-CoV-2 strain showed it belonged to lineage B.1.1., sharing the last common ancestor with SARS-CoV-2 strains recovered from South Africa. At the African continental level, our analysis showed that lineage B.1 and B.1.1 lineages appear to be predominant in Africa. Whole genome sequence analysis should be part of all surveillance and case detection activities in order to monitor the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages across Africa.
A case report of newborn infant with severe COVID-19 in Mexico: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human breast milk and stool;Although COVID-19 in pregnant women and their neonates has been demonstrated, there is not enough evidence about how this vertical transmission occurs. This report describes a SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 21-year-old mother-daughter duo at the time of birth, focusing on the viral RNA detection in the stool of both and the human breast milk.
What defines an efficacious COVID-19 vaccine? A review of the challenges assessing the clinical efficacy of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2;The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused more than 1 million deaths in the first 6 months of the pandemic and huge economic and social upheaval internationally. An efficacious vaccine is essential to prevent further morbidity and mortality. Although some countries might deploy COVID-19 vaccines on the strength of safety and immunogenicity data alone, the goal of vaccine development is to gain direct evidence of vaccine efficacy in protecting humans against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 so that manufacture of efficacious vaccines can be selectively upscaled. A candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 might act against infection, disease, or transmission, and a vaccine capable of reducing any of these elements could contribute to disease control. However, the most important efficacy endpoint, protection against severe disease and death, is difficult to assess in phase 3 clinical trials. In this Review, we explore the challenges in assessing the efficacy of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, discuss the caveats needed to interpret reported efficacy endpoints, and provide insight into answering the seemingly simple question, “Does this COVID-19 vaccine work?”
Viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 could be self-limitative – The role of the renin-angiotensin system on COVID-19 pathophysiology;Currently, the world is suffering with one of the biggest pandemics of recent history. Caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is provoking devastating consequences on economic and social fields throughout all continents. Therefore, pathophysiological knowledge about COVID-19 is imperative for better planning of preventive measures, diagnosis, and therapeutics of the disease. Based on previous studies, this work proposes new hypothesis related to the role of the renin-angiotensin system on the pathophysiology of COVID-19, and its purpose is to enrich the discussion and to offer alternative ways for experimental and clinical studies aiming at the formulation of new diagnosis and/or treatment methods.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in hospital wastewater from a low COVID-19 disease prevalence area;Previous studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV reported the detection of viral RNA in the stool of both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. These clinical observations suggest that municipal and hospital wastewater from affected communities may contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Recent studies have also reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human feces. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising approach to understand the prevalence of viruses in a given catchment population, as wastewater contains viruses from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The current study reports the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in untreated wastewater in Slovenia. Two sizes of centrifugal filters were tested: 30 kDa and 10 kDA AMICON® Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filters, where 10 kDA resulted in a higher concentration factor and higher recovery efficiency. The results in hospital wastewater show that WBE can be used for monitoring COVID −19 and could be applied in municipal wastewater treatment plants as a potential complementary tool for public health monitoring at population level.
Detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and treated effluents: Surveillance of COVID-19 epidemic in the United Arab Emirates;Testing SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in wastewater has recently emerged as a method of tracking the prevalence of the virus and an early-warning tool for predicting outbreaks in the future. This study reports SARS-CoV-2 viral load in wastewater influents and treated effluents of 11 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), as well as untreated wastewater from 38 various locations, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in May and June 2020. Composite samples collected over twenty-four hours were thermally deactivated for safety, followed by viral concentration using ultrafiltration, RNA extraction using commercially available kits, and viral quantification using RT-qPCR. Furthermore, estimates of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different regions were simulated using Monte Carlo. Results showed that the viral load in wastewater influents from these WWTPs ranged from 7.50E+02 to over 3.40E+04 viral gene copies/L with some plants having no detectable viral RNA by RT-qPCR. The virus was also detected in 85% of untreated wastewater samples taken from different locations across the country, with viral loads in positive samples ranging between 2.86E+02 and over 2.90E+04 gene copies/L. It was also observed that the precautionary measures implemented by the UAE government correlated with a drop in the measured viral load in wastewater samples, which were in line with the reduction of COVID-19 cases reported in the population. Importantly, none of the 11 WWTPs' effluents tested positive during the entire sampling period, indicating that the treatment technologies used in the UAE are efficient in degrading SARS-CoV-2, and confirming the safety of treated re-used water in the country. SARS-CoV-2 wastewater testing has the potential to aid in monitoring or predicting an outbreak location and can shed light on the extent viral spread at the community level.
Low dose and oral exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may help us understand and prevent severe COVID-19;The effectiveness and sustainability of current public health interventions designed to prevent SARS-2-CoV transmission remain of great concern in many settings, especially in the absence of a transmission-preventing vaccine.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in Japan during a COVID-19 outbreak;The presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater samples has been documented in several countries. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is potentially effective for early warning of a COVID-19 outbreak. In this study, presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples was investigated and was compared with the number of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in the study area during COVID-19 outbreak in Japan. In total, 45 influent wastewater samples were collected from five wastewater treatment plants in Ishikawa and Toyama prefectures in Japan. During the study period, the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in these prefectures increased from 0.3 and 0 to >20 per 100,000 people. SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the samples was detected using several PCR-based assays. Of the 45 samples, 21 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 according to at least one of the three quantitative RT-PCR assays. The detection frequency increased when the number of total confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in 100,000 people exceeded 10 in each prefecture
First confirmed detection of SARS-COV-2 in untreated municipal and aircraft wastewater in Dubai, UAE: The use of wastewater based epidemiology as an early warning tool to monitor the prevalence of COVID-19;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome – Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China and spread to more than 114 countries resulting in a pandemic, which was declared by the WHO in March 2020. Tracking the spread of the virus raised a main concern in every country. Many researches proved the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples of patients, where the genes of this virus gave a positive signal several days prior to the occurrence of symptoms. The fact of viral shedding in stools provides an advantage in utilizing wastewater systems as a tool to monitor the viral prevalence. We tested more than 2900 municipal wastewater samples coming from 49 distinctive area in Dubai, where 28.6% showed positive results. We also looked into the wastewater samples from 198 commercial aircrafts arriving at Dubai Airport, giving a positive result percentage of 13.6%. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 genes was confirmed using TaqPath™ Covid-19 RT-PCR kit, which targets 
Hospital indoor air quality monitoring for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus;On December 31, 2019, the novel human coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China and swiftly spread in all nations and territories around the globe. There is much debate about the major route of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmissions. So, more evidence is required to determine the potential pathway of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 including airborne transmission. Therefore, we examined the potential aerosol transmission of the virus through hospital wards indoor air by confirmed COVID-19 patients on May 7, 2020. In order to capture airborne SARS-CoV-2, the liquid impinger biosampler was used to take fourteen air samples in different wards of the indoor air of the hospital. The specific primer and probe real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were applied to detect viral genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in positive air samples. Accordingly, we found two positive air samples (in the ICU) out of 14 ones taken from different wards with confirmed COVID-19 patients. The results revealed the possibility of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 though more studies are required to determine the role of actual mechanisms such as cough, sneeze, normal breathing and speaking in the emission of airborne size carrier aerosols. Likewise, more quantitative analyses are needed to estimate airborne viability of SARS-CoV-2 in the carrier aerosols.
Importation of SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to major COVID-19 epidemic in Taiwan;COVID-19 has recently become a pandemic affecting many countries worldwide. This study aims to evaluate the current status of COVID-19 in Taiwan and analyze the source of infection.
SARS-CoV-2 turned positive in a discharged patient with COVID-19 arouses concern regarding the present standards for discharge;An outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to a serious epidemic in China and other countries, resulting in worldwide concern. With active efforts of prevention and control, more and more patients are being discharged. However, how to manage these patients normatively is still challenging. This paper reports an asymptomatic discharged patient with COVID-19 who retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, which arouses concern regarding the present discharge standards of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Superspreader Events;A significant number of reported COVID-19 cases can be traced back to superspreader events (SSEs), where a disproportionally large number of secondary cases relative to the standard reproductive rate, R0, are initiated. Although a superspreader is an individual who undergoes more viral shedding and transmission than others, it appears likely that environmental factors have a substantial role in SSEs. We categorise SSEs into two distinct groups: ‘societal’ and ‘isolated’ SSEs.
Four point-of-care lateral flow immunoassays for diagnosis of COVID-19 and for assessing dynamics of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2;We aimed to evaluate the role of rapid serological tests in the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.
Recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in COVID-19: A case report;The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan, China, has constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, with cases confirmed in multiple countries. Currently, patients are the primary source of infection. We report a confirmed case of COVID-19 whose oropharyngeal swab test of SARS-CoV-2 RNA turned positive in convalescence. This case highlights the importance of active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for infectivity assessment.
Diagnostic serial interval as a novel indicator for contact tracing effectiveness exemplified with the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea;The clinical onset serial interval is often used as a proxy for the transmission interval of an infectious disease. For SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, data on clinical onset serial intervals is limited, since symptom onset dates are not routinely recorded and do not exist in asymptomatic carriers.
Shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in feces and urine and its potential role in person-to-person transmission and the environment-based spread of COVID-19;The recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces has led to speculation that it can be transmitted via the fecal-oral/ocular route. This review aims to critically evaluate the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, the quantity and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in feces and urine, and whether these pose an infection risk in sanitary settings, sewage networks, wastewater treatment plants, and the wider environment (e.g. rivers, lakes and marine waters). A review of 48 independent studies revealed that severe GI dysfunction is only evident in a small number of COVID-19 cases, with 11 ± 2% exhibiting diarrhea and 12 ± 3% exhibiting vomiting and nausea. In addition to these cases, SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in feces from some asymptomatic, mildly- and pre-symptomatic individuals. Fecal shedding of the virus peaks in the symptomatic period and can persist for several weeks, but with declining abundances in the post-symptomatic phase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is occasionally detected in urine, but reports in fecal samples are more frequent. The abundance of the virus genetic material in both urine (ca. 10
Rapid implementation of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing to investigate cases of health-care associated COVID-19: a prospective genomic surveillance study;The burden and influence of health-care associated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections is unknown. We aimed to examine the use of rapid SARS-CoV-2 sequencing combined with detailed epidemiological analysis to investigate health-care associated SARS-CoV-2 infections and inform infection control measures.
Relationship of the cycle threshold values of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction and total severity score of computerized tomography in patients with COVID 19;Studies analyzing viral load in COVID-19 patients and any data that compare viral load with chest computerized tomography (CT) severity are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the severity of chest CT in reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive patients and factors associated with it.
Four point-of-care lateral flow immunoassays for diagnosis of COVID-19 and for assessing dynamics of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2;We aimed to evaluate the role of rapid serological tests in the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.
Mortality in COVID-19 disease patients: Correlating the association of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) with severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants;Genetic factors such as the HLA type of patients may play a role in regard to disease severity and clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19. Taking the data deposited in the GISAID database, we made predictions using the IEDB analysis resource (TepiTool) to gauge how variants in the SARS-CoV-2 genome may change peptide binding to the most frequent MHC-class I and -II alleles in Africa, Asia and Europe. We caracterized how a single mutation in the wildtype sequence of of SARS-CoV-2 could influence the peptide binding of SARS-CoV-2 variants to MHC class II, but not to MHC class I alleles. Assuming the ORF8 (L84S) mutation is biologically significant, selective pressure from MHC class II alleles may select for viral varients and subsequently shape the quality and quantity of cellular immune responses aginast SARS-CoV-2. MHC 4-digit typing along with viral sequence analysis should be considered in studies examining clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19.
First confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 in untreated wastewater in Australia: A proof of concept for the wastewater surveillance of COVID-19 in the community;Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is accompanied by the shedding of the virus in stool. Therefore, the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater affords the ability to monitor the prevalence of infections among the population via wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). In the current work, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater in a catchment in Australia and viral RNA copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) resulting in two positive detections within a six day period from the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The estimated viral RNA copy numbers observed in the wastewater were then used to estimate the number of infected individuals in the catchment via Monte Carlo simulation. Given the uncertainty and variation in the input parameters, the model estimated a median range of 171 to 1,090 infected persons in the catchment, which is in reasonable agreement with clinical observations. This work highlights the viability of WBE for monitoring infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in communities. The work also draws attention to the need for further methodological and molecular assay validation for enveloped viruses in wastewater.
First proof of the capability of wastewater surveillance for COVID-19 in India through detection of genetic material of SARS-CoV-2;We made the first ever successful effort in India to detect the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 viruses to understand the capability and application of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) surveillance in India. Sampling was carried out on 8 and 27 May 2020 at the Old Pirana Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) at Ahmedabad, Gujarat that receives effluent from Civil Hospital treating COVID-19 patients. All three, i.e. ORF1ab, N and S genes of SARS-CoV-2, were found in the influent with no genes detected in effluent collected on 8 and 27 May 2020. Increase in SARS-CoV-2 genetic loading in the wastewater between 8 and 27 May 2020 samples concurred with corresponding increase in the number of active COVID-19 patients in the city. The number of gene copies was comparable to that reported in untreated wastewaters of Australia, China and Turkey and lower than that of the USA, France and Spain. However, temporal changes in SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations need to be substantiated further from the perspectives of daily and short-term changes of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater through long-term monitoring. The study results SARS-CoV-2 will assist concerned authorities and policymakers to formulate and/or upgrade COVID-19 surveillance to have a more explicit picture of the pandemic curve. While infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 through the excreted viral genetic material in the aquatic environment is still being debated, the presence and detection of genes in wastewater systems makes a strong case for the environmental surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minimization of spreading of SARS-CoV-2 via household waste produced by subjects affected by COVID-19 or in quarantine;Currently available evidence supports that the predominant route of human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 is through respiratory droplets. Indirect hands contact with surfaces contaminated by infectious droplets subsequently touching the mouth, nose or eyes seems to be another route of an indirect contact transmission. Persistence of the virus on different surfaces and other materials has been reported in recent studies: SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard. Viable virus was detected up to 72 h after application to different surfaces, although infectivity decay was also observed. This evidence suggests the likelihood that waste generated from patients affected by COVID-19 or subjects in quarantine treated in private houses or in areas different from hospitals and medical centres could be contaminated by SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, waste streams may represent a route for viral spreading being a potential risk also for the operators directly involved in the different phases of waste management. To address this concern, a specific multidisciplinary working group was settled by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) during the COVID-19 emergency, in order to establish guidelines related to solid waste collection, delivering, withdrawal, transport, treatment and disposal. Temporary stop of waste sorting, instructions for the population on how to package waste, instructions for Companies and operators for the adoption of adequate personal protection equipment (PPE), the use and sanitation of proper vehicles were among the main recommendations provided to the community by publications of freely downloadable reports and infographics in layman language. Incineration, sterilization and properly managed landfills were identified as the facilities to be preferentially adopted for the treatment of this kind of waste, considering the main inactivation strategies of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. treatment length > 9 days and temperature > 70 °C for more than 5 min).
Diagnostic yield of repeat testing for SARS-CoV-2: Experience from a large health system in Los Angeles;To determine the diagnostic yield of repeat testing for SARS-CoV-2.

Clinical characteristics and changes of chest CT features in 307 patients with common COVID-19 pneumonia infected SARS-CoV-2: A multicenter study in Jiangsu, China;The study was aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and evaluate the dynamic changes of chest CT features in the first three weeks in the common type fo COVID-19 pneumonia patients in Jiangsu Province.
Comparison of Automated SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test for COVID-19 Infection with Quantitative RT-PCR using 313 Nasopharyngeal Swabs Including from 7 Serially Followed Patients;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is determined by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in routine clinical practice. In the current pandemic situation, a more rapid and high-throughput method is in growing demand. Here, we validated the performance of a new antigen test (LUMIPULSE) based on the chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay. A total of 313 nasopharyngeal swabs (82 serial samples from 7 infected patients, 231 individual samples from 4 infected patients and 215 non-infected individuals) were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and then subjected to LUMIPULSE. We determined the cutoff value for antigen detection using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and compared the antigen test performance with that of RT-qPCR. Further, we compared the viral loads and antigen levels in serial samples from seven infected patients. When using RT-qPCR as the reference, the antigen test exhibited 55.2% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity with a 91.4% overall agreement rate (286/313). In specimens with > 100 viral copies and between 10 and 100 copies, the antigen test showed 100% and 85% concordance with RT-qPCR, respectively. This concordance declined with lower viral loads. In the serially followed patients, the antigen levels showed a steady decline along with viral clearance. This gradual decline was in contrast with the abrupt “positive-to-negative” and “negative-to-positive” status changes observed with RT-qPCR, particularly in the late phase of infection. In summary, the LUMIPULSE antigen test can rapidly identify SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with moderate to high viral loads and may be helpful for monitoring viral clearance in hospitalized patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in raw and treated wastewater in Germany – Suitability for COVID-19 surveillance and potential transmission risks;Wastewater-based monitoring of the spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, also referred to as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), has been suggested as a tool to support epidemiology. An extensive sampling campaign, including nine municipal wastewater treatment plants, has been conducted in different cities of the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) on the same day in April 2020, close to the first peak of the corona crisis. Samples were processed and analysed for a set of SARS-CoV-2-specific genes, as well as pan-genotypic gene sequences also covering other coronavirus types, using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Additionally, a comprehensive set of chemical reference parameters and bioindicators was analysed to characterize the wastewater quality and composition. Results of the RT-qPCR based gene analysis indicate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic traces in different raw wastewaters. Furthermore, selected samples have been sequenced using Sanger technology to confirm the specificity of the RT-qPCR and the origin of the coronavirus. A comparison of the particle-bound and the dissolved portion of SARS-CoV-2 virus genes shows that quantifications must not neglect the solid-phase reservoir. The infectivity of the raw wastewater has also been assessed by viral outgrowth assay with a potential SARS-CoV2- host cell line in vitro, which were not infected when exposed to the samples. This first evidence suggests that wastewater might be no major route for transmission to humans. Our findings draw attention to the need for further methodological and molecular assay validation for enveloped viruses in wastewater.
Could sudden sensorineural hearing loss be the sole manifestation of COVID-19? An investigation into SARS-COV-2 in the etiology of sudden sensorineural hearing loss;This study aimed to investigate the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients presenting with only sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHNL) during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Could the D614G substitution in the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein be associated with higher COVID-19 mortality?;The increasing number of deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic has raised serious global concerns. Increased testing capacity and ample intensive care availability could explain lower mortality in some countries compared to others. Nevertheless, it is also plausible that the SARS-CoV-2 mutations giving rise to different phylogenetic clades are responsible for the apparent death rate disparities around the world. Current research literature linking the genetic make-up of SARS-CoV-2 with fatalities is lacking. Here, we suggest that this disparity in fatality rates may be attributed to SARS-CoV-2 evolving mutations and urge the international community to begin addressing the phylogenetic clade classification of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to clinical outcomes.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal specimens of patients with confirmed COVID-19: A meta-analysis;Recent studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be found in fecal specimens of COVID-19 patients, but the sample size is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal specimens of these patients according to their clinical characteristics.
Particulate matter and SARS-CoV-2: A possible model of COVID-19 transmission;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an acute respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly developed into a pandemic throughout the world. This disease is a highly infectious novel coronavirus and can affect people of all ages. Previous reports observed that particulate matter (PM) provided a platform for intermixing with viruses (i.e., influenza). However, the role of PM in SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains unclear. In this paper, we propose that PM plays a direct role as a “carrier” of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is reported to have a high affinity for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Indirectly, exposure to PM increases ACE2 expression in the lungs which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 viral adhesion. Thus, the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 in heavily polluted regions can be explained by upregulation of ACE2 caused by PM. PM could be both a direct and indirect transmission model for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
One case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a patient co-infected by HIV with a low CD4;The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan, China, become an emergency of international concern when thousands of people were infected around the world. This study reports a case simultaneously infected by SARS-Cov-2 and HIV, which showed a longer disease course and slower generation of specific antibodies. This case highlights that a co-infection of SARS-Cov-2 and HIV may severely impair the immune system.
Is the presence of lung injury in COVID-19 an independent risk factor for secondary lung cancer?;The morbidity and mortality of lung cancer are increasing. The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV-2, leading to subsequent pulmonary interstitial fibrosis with chronic inflammatory changes, e.g., inflammatory factors repeatedly continuously stimulating and attacking the alveolar epithelial cells. Meanwhile, 2019-nCoV-2 can activate PI3K/Akt and ERK signaling pathways, which can play the double roles as both anti-inflammatory and carcinogenic factors. Moreover, hypoxemia may be developed, resulting in the up-regulation of HIF-1 α expression, which can be involved in the occurrence, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis of lung cancer. Additionally, the immune system in 2019-nCoV-2 infected cases can be suppressed to cause tumor immune evasion. Therefore, we speculate that COVID-19 may be a risk factor of secondary lung cancer.
;COVID-19 was originated from Wuhan city of Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since then it has spread in more than 210 countries and territories. It is a viral disease due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The patients show flu-like symptoms with a dry cough, sore throat, high fever, and breathing problems. The disease due to SARS-CoV-2 was named as COVID-19. About 2.2 million people have been infected with more than 0.15 million deaths globally. The United States of America is the most affected country with the highest patients of about 0.7 million. Despite great efforts, there is no treatment of this disease. However, prevention and management are the best options. This article describes SARS-CoV-2, disease, prevention and management, treatment and social impact on society. It was analyzed that a combination of antiviral drugs with hydroxyl-chloroquine and azithromycin (with the consultation of a medical practitioner) may be the best option to treat the patients, depending on the patient's conditions and symptoms. However, Unani therapy may be useful along with allopathic treatment. It is urgently advised and requested that all the persons should follow the preventive measures, managements and quarantine strictly without any religious discrepancy otherwise the situation may be the worst. Also, there is an urgent requirement to educate our new generation for science and technology to fight against any such disaster in future
Case studies of SARS-CoV-2 treated with favipiravir among patients in critical or severe condition;The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is rising globally. However, clinically effective antiviral treatments are not established. Favipiravir may prevent pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome aggravation. We describe SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, two of whom were in a critical condition and one of whom was in a severe condition, who were administered favipiravir for their deteriorating conditions and cured.
Isolation and phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants collected in Russia during the COVID-19 outbreak;The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in December 2019 in China and then spread worldwide over the following months, involving 188 countries. The objective of this study was to determine the molecular epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak in Russia.
Patients with COVID-19 and neurological manifestations show undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in the cerebrospinal fluid;We report that patients with COVID-19 displaying distinct neurological disorders have undetectable or extremely low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid, indicating that viral clearance precede the neurological involvement. This finding points to the need for the development of more sensitive molecular tests and the investigation of other neurotropic pathogens to exclude concurrent neuroinfection.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA residue on object surfaces in nucleic acid testing laboratory using droplet digital PCR;The rapid development of global COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge to the safety and quality of laboratory diagnostic testing. Little is known about the laboratory surface areas and operation behaviors that may cause potential contamination in SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing. This study aims to provide reference basis for the improvement of laboratory disinfection programs and personal operating protocols. In this study, we compared the qRT-PCR and ddPCR in detecting of residual virus that existed on the object surfaces from sample transportation and reception related facilities, testing related instruments, personal protective equipment and other facilities in nucleic acid testing laboratory. All samples were negative by qRT-PCR, in contrast, 13 of 61 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by ddPCR. The areas with highest density of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid were the outer gloves of operator A (37.4 copies/cm
SARS-CoV-2 in the environment: Modes of transmission, early detection and potential role of pollutions;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading globally having a profound effect on lives of millions of people, causing worldwide economic disruption. Curbing the spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics may be accomplished through understanding the environmental context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and adoption of effective detection tools and mitigation policies. This article aims to examine the latest investigations on SARS-CoV-2 plausible environmental transmission modes, employment of wastewater surveillance for early detection of COVID-19, and elucidating the role of solid waste, water, and atmospheric quality on viral infectivity. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via faecal-oral or bio-aerosols lacks robust evidence and remains debatable. However, improper disinfection and defected plumbing systems in indoor environments such as hospitals and high-rise towers may facilitate the transport of virus-laden droplets of wastewater causing infection. Clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to present robust evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible via aerosols, though quantification of virus-laden aerosols at low concentrations presents a challenge. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can be an effective tool in early detection of outbreak and determination of COVID-19 prevalence within a population, complementing clinical testing and providing decision makers guidance on restricting or relaxing movement. While poor air quality increases susceptibility to diseases, evidence for air pollution impact on COVID-19 infectivity is not available as infections are dynamically changing worldwide. Solid waste generated by households with infected individuals during the lockdown period may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 via fomite transmission route but has received little attention from the scientific community. Water bodies receiving raw sewage may pose risk of infection but this has not been investigated to date. Overall, our understanding of the environmental perspective of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to detecting outbreak and predicting pandemic severity, allowing us to be equipped with the right tools to curb any future pandemic.
Evolutionary analysis of SARS-CoV-2: how mutation of Non-Structural Protein 6 (NSP6) could affect viral autophagy;SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus that has spread globally, infecting more than 150000 people, and being declared pandemic by the WHO.

First known person-to-person transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the USA;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first detected in China in December, 2019. In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA.
Epidemic update of COVID-19 in Hubei Province compared with other regions in China;The COVID-19 outbreak spread in China and is a threat to the world. The aims of this study to help health workers better understand the epidemic of the COVID-19 and provide different control strategies toward Hubei Province and other regions in China.
;The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase. When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have discussed the structure of virus
Bone biology and COVID-19 infection: Is ACE2 a potential influence factor?;The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a severe threat to global health management system since it has been detected in the human body. This pandemic was prompted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and rapidly developed into a public emergency with an alarming increase in cases and deaths. The increasing explorations to SARS-CoV-2 infection guide us to consider whether bone lesion is followed by this pathologic process. We especially focus on the underlying pathobiology that SARS-CoV-2 possibly mediated in bone remodeling and analyze the association of bone destruction with ACE2 in COVID-19 incidence, for preferable understanding the pathogenesis and providing necessary clinical management in orthopedics.
Presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in isolation ward environment 28 days after exposure;Recent studies have reported that surfaces and objects in the rooms of infected patients that are frequently touched by both medical staff and patients could be contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. In December 2019, Wuhan China suffered the earliest from this COVID-19 pandemic, and we took that opportunity to investigate whether the SARS-CoV-2 RNA exists in the ward environment after a long time from exposure. We found that on the 28th day following the discharge of COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA could still be detected on the surfaces of pagers and in drawers in the isolation wards. Thorough disinfection of the ward environment was subsequently performed, after which these surfaces in the isolation wards tested negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The findings remind us that the contaminated environment in the wards may become potential infectious resources and that despite a long time from exposure, the thorough disinfection in the COVID-10 units after is still necessary.
Fast SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR in preheated nasopharyngeal swab samples;The gold-standard COVID-19 diagnosis relies on detecting SARS-CoV-2 using RNA purification and one-step retrotranscription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Based on the urgent need for high-throughput screening, we tested the performance of three alternative, simple and affordable protocols to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2, bypassing the long and tedious RNA extraction step and reducing the time to viral detection.
SARS-CoV-2 detection, viral load and infectivity over the course of an infection;To summarise the evidence on the detection pattern and viral load of SARS-CoV-2 over the course of an infection (including any asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic phase), and the duration of infectivity.
Association of COVID-19 pandemic with meteorological parameters over Singapore;Meteorological parameters are the critical factors affecting the transmission of infectious diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and influenza. Consequently, infectious disease incidence rates are likely to be influenced by the weather change. This study investigates the role of Singapore's hot tropical weather in COVID-19 transmission by exploring the association between meteorological parameters and the COVID-19 pandemic cases in Singapore. This study uses the secondary data of COVID-19 daily cases from the webpage of Ministry of Health (MOH), Singapore. Spearman and Kendall rank correlation tests were used to investigate the correlation between COVID-19 and meteorological parameters. Temperature, dew point, relative humidity, absolute humidity, and water vapor showed positive significant correlation with COVID-19 pandemic. These results will help the epidemiologists to understand the behavior of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus against meteorological variables. This study finding would be also a useful supplement to help the local healthcare policymakers, Center for Disease Control (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO) in the process of strategy making to combat COVID-19 in Singapore.
The hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 affects male reproductive ability by regulating autophagy;The outbreak of CoronaVirus Disease19 (COVID19) in December 2019 posed a serious threat to public safety, and its rapid spread caused a global health emergency. Clinical data show that in addition to respiratory system damage, some male patients with COVID-19 are also accompanied by abnormal renal function and even renal damage. As the main receptor of syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is also found to be highly expressed not only in respiratory mucosa and alveolar epithelial cells, but also in renal tubule cells, testicular Leydig cells and seminiferous tubule cells. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has the possibility of infecting the male reproductive system, and the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the patient's semen further confirms this theory. In previous studies, it has been found that ACE2 has the ability to regulate autophagy. Not only that, recent studies have also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection can also lead to a reduction in autophagy. All of these associate SARS-CoV-2 with autophagy. Furthermore, autophagy has been shown to have an effect on male reproduction in many studies. Based on these, we propose the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 affects male reproductive function by regulating autophagy. This hypothesis may provide a new idea for future treatment of COVID-19 male patients with reproductive function injury, and it can also prompt medical staff and patients to consciously check their reproductive function.
Self-reported loss of smell without nasal obstruction to identify COVID-19. The multicenter Coranosmia cohort study;To determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples in a subset of patients consulting for primarily isolated acute (<7 days) loss of smell and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of olfactory/gustatory dysfunction for COVID-19 diagnosis in the overall population tested for COVID-19 in the same period.
;COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus structurally similar to SARS-CoV. Based on both structural and syndromic similarities with SARS-CoV, a hypothesis is formed on SARS-CoV-2 potential to affect the host’s metabolism as part of its lifecycle. This hypothesis is evaluated by (a) exploratory analysis of SARS-CoV/human transcriptomic interaction data and gene set enrichment analysis (b) a confirmatory, focused review of the literature based on the findings by (a). A STRING Viruses (available search for human – SARS-CoV (NCBI taxonomy Id: 9606 vs. NCBI taxonomy Id: 694009) genomic interactions reveals ten human proteins, interacting with SARS-CoV: SGTA, FGL2, SPECC1, STAT3, PHB, BCL2L1, PPP1CA, CAV1, JUN, XPO1. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) with STRING on this network revealed their role as a putative protein – protein interaction network (PPI
Comparison of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 detection in 353 patients received tests with both specimens simultaneously;Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan in December 2019, by March 10, 2020, a total of 80,932 confirmed cases have been reported in China. Two consecutively negative RT-PCR test results in respiratory tract specimens is required for the evaluation of discharge from hospital, and oropharyngeal swabs were the most common sample. However, false negative results occurred in the late stage of hospitalization, and avoiding false negative result is critical essential.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection of hospital isolation wards hygiene monitoring during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak in a Chinese hospital;The aim of this paper was to monitor the presence of SARS-Cov-2 among hospital environment surfaces, sewage, and personal protective equipment (PPE) of staffs in isolation wards in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, China.
;Coronaviruses, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, first appeared in China. They have certain biological, epidemiological and pathological similarities. To date, research has shown that their genes exhibit 79% of identical sequences and the receptor-binding domain structure is also very similar. There has been extensive research performed on SARS
;The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in unprecedented disease burden, healthcare costs, and economic impacts worldwide. Despite several measures, SARS-CoV-2 has been extremely impactful due to its extraordinary infection potential mainly through coronavirus-borne saliva respiratory and droplet nuclei of an infected person and its considerable stability on surfaces. Although the disease has affected over 180 countries, its extent and control are significantly different across the globe, making it a strong case for exploration of its behavior and dependence across various environmental pathways and its interactions with the virus. This has spurred efforts to characterize the coronavirus and understand the factors impacting its transmission and survival such as aerosols, air quality, meteorology, chemical compositions and characteristics of particles and surfaces, which are directly or indirectly associated with coronaviruses infection spread. Nonetheless, many peer-reviewed articles have studied these aspects but mostly in isolation
Quantifying the improvement in confirmation efficiency of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the early phase of the outbreak in Hong Kong in 2020;The emerging virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused a large outbreak of coronavirus disease, COVID-19, in Wuhan, China, since December 2019. COVID-19 soon spread to other regions of China and overseas. In Hong Kong, local mitigation measures were implemented since the first imported case was confirmed on January 23, 2020. Here we evaluated the temporal variation of detection delay from symptoms onset to laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong.
Cluster infections play important roles in the rapid evolution of COVID-19 transmission: a systematic review;To summarize the major types of cluster infections of SARS-CoV-2 all over the world through a comprehensive systematic review.
Dynamic profile for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using four immunochromatographic assays;In order to fight the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic infection, there is a growing need and demand for diagnostic tools that are complementary and different from the RT-PCR currently in use. Multiple serological tests are or will be very soon available but need to be evaluated and validated. We have thus tested 4 immunochromatographic tests for the detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we assessed the kinetics of antibody appearance using these assays in 22 patients after they were tested positive by RT-PCR. We observed great heterogeneity in antibody detection post-symptom onset. The median antibody detection time was between 8 and 10 days according to the manufacturers. All the tests showed a sensitivity of 60 to 80% on day 10 and 100% on day 15. In addition, a single cross-reaction was observed with other human coronavirus infections. Thus, immunochromatographic tests for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may have their place for the diagnostic panel of COVID-19.
Hydroxychloroquine as an aerosol might markedly reduce and even prevent severe clinical symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection;Covid-19 is a new coronavirus disease first described in December 2019. This respiratory illness is severe and potentially fatal. Severe cases make up to 15%, lethality ranges between 1.5 and more than 10%. What is urgently needed is an efficient pharmacological treatment for the treatment of severe cases. During the infection of alveolar epithelial cells of the lung, the ACE2 receptor has a central function. The antimalarial drugs chloroquine phosphate (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) impair in vitro the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 without significant change of cell-surface ACE2 and, therefore, might be potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Starting inhibition at 0.1 µM, CQ completely prevented in vitro infections at 10 µM, suggesting a prophylactic effect and preventing the virus spread 5 h after infection. In a first clinical trial, CQ was effective in inhibiting exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promotion of virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease. In addition, HCQ, which is three times more potent than CQ in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (EC50 0.72 µM), was significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Theoretically, CQ and HCQ could thus be effectively used in the treatment of SARS-CoV pneumonia. From a pharmacological standpoint, however, the major problems of oral treatment with these drugs are possible severe side effects and toxicity. Concretely, this relates to (a) the inconsistent individual bioavailability of these drugs at the alveolar target cells, depending on intestinal resorption, hepatic first-pass metabolism and accumulation in liver, spleen and lung, and (b) the need for a relatively high concentration of 1–5 µM at the alveolar surface.
Recreational waters – A potential transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 to humans?;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory illness caused by the novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has lead to high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide, has been causing major public health concerns since first detected in late 2019. Following identification of novel pathogens, questions in relation to dissemination of the pathogen and transmission routes begin to emerge. This rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 virus has been detected in both faecal and wastewater samples across the globe, highlighting the potential for faecal-oral transmission of the virus. As a result, concerns regarding the transmission of the virus in the environment and the risk associated with contracting the virus in recreational waters, particularly where inadequately treated wastewater is discharged, have been emerging in recent weeks. This paper highlights the need for further research to be carried out to investigate the presence, infectivity and viability of this newly identified SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater effluent and receiving recreational waters.
On airborne transmission and control of SARS-Cov-2;The COVID-19 pandemic is creating a havoc situation across the globe that modern society has ever seen. Despite of their paramount importance, the transmission routes of SARS-Cov-2 still remain debated among various sectors. Evidences compiled here strongly suggest that the COVID-19 could be transmitted via air in inadequately ventilated environments. Existing experimental data showed that coronavirus survival was negatively impacted by ozone, high temperature and low humidity. Here, regression analysis showed that the spread of SARS-Cov-2 was reduced by increasing ambient ozone concentration level from 48.83 to 94.67 μg/m
SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater: State of the knowledge and research needs;The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, which was officially declared by the World Health Organization. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A co-infection in an Italian patient: Mini-review of the literature;A case of acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A co-infection and a mini-review of the literature is reported. Even in COVID-19 epidemics, the early identification of concurrent respiratory pathogens is important to improve etiological diagnosis, preventive measures and patients’ clinical management and outcome.
SARS-CoV-2 in river water: Implications in low sanitation countries;Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic studies on viral shedding have reported that this virus is excreted in feces in most patients. High viral loads are found at the sewage pipeline or at the entrance of wastewater treatment plants from cities where the number of COVID-19 cases are significant. In Quito (Ecuador) as in many other cities worldwide, wastewater is directly discharged into natural waters. The aim of this study was to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 presence in urban streams from a low sanitation context. Three river locations along the urban rivers of Quito were sampled on the 5th of June during a peak of COVID-19 cases. River samples were evaluated for water quality parameters and afterwards, concentrated for viral analysis using skimmed milk flocculation method. The viral concentrates were quantified for SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2 target regions) and Human Adenovirus as a human viral indicator. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected for both target regions in all samples analyzed in a range of 2,91E+05 to 3,19E+06 GC/L for N1 and from 2,07E+05 to 2,22E+06 GC/L for N2. The high values detected in natural waters from a low sanitation region have several implications in health and ecology that should be further assessed.
Evaluating the efficacy of RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 direct approaches in comparison to RNA extraction;SARS-CoV-2 genetic identification is based on viral RNA extraction prior to RT-qPCR assay, however recent studies support the elimination of the extraction step. Herein, we assessed the RNA extraction necessity, by comparing RT-qPCR efficacy in several direct approaches vs. the gold standard RNA extraction, in detection of SARS-CoV-2 from laboratory samples as well as clinical Oro-nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 swabs. Our findings show advantage for the extraction procedure, however a direct no-buffer approach might be an alternative, since it identified more than 60% of positive clinical specimens.
Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 with high dose oral zinc salts: A report on four patients;Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with substantial mortality and no accepted therapy. We report here on four consecutive outpatients with clinical characteristics (CDC case definition) of and/or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were treated with high dose zinc salt oral lozenges. All four patients experienced significant improvement in objective and symptomatic disease measures after one day of high dose therapy suggesting that zinc therapy was playing a role in clinical recovery. A mechanism for zinc’s effects is proposed based on previously published studies on SARS- CoV-1, and randomized controlled trials assessing zinc shortening of common cold duration. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the effectiveness of zinc as a treatment for COVID-19 but suggest the variables to be addressed to confirm these initial findings in future trials.
Towards a pharmacochemical hypothesis of the prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 by psychoactive substances;An increasing body of evidence suggests a protective effect of some psychoactive substances against SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus type 2). Recent findings suggest that patients with psychiatric disorders are less affected by SARS-CoV-2 than their caregivers, which may seem surprising given some of the frequent risk factors for an unfavorable course of the disease (e.g., obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases).
Clinical Characteristics of Asymptomatic Patients with COVID-19: A Nationwide Cohort Study in South Korea;To delineate clinical characteristics of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients confirmed with COVID-19 in South Korea.
Comparison of hospitalized patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19 and influenza A in children under 5 years;Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, considerable attention has been paid to its epidemiology and clinical characteristics in children. However, it is also crucial for clinicians to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza viruses.
A putative role for the tobacco mosaic virus in smokers’ resistance to COVID-19;Reports from various countries suggest that tobacco smoking might protect from SARS-CoV-2 infection, since the prevalence of smoking in COVID-19 hospitalized patients is lower than in the respective general population. Apart from nicotine or other chemicals contained in tobacco smoke, we propose that a single-stranded RNA virus that infects tobacco leaves, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), might be implicated in this effect. TMV, though non-pathogenic, is found in smokers’ airways, and stimulates adaptive and innate immunity, with release of specific antibodies and interferons. The latter may have preventive and/or therapeutic effects against COVID-19.
Preliminary estimation of the basic reproduction number of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China, from 2019 to 2020: A data-driven analysis in the early phase of the outbreak;An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit a major city in China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other provinces/regions of China and other countries. We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, 
Mevalonate pathway, selenoproteins, redox balance, immune system, Covid-19: Reasoning about connections;It has been proposed that a degraded immune system is (one of) the condition(s) that predispose certain subjects to fatal consequences from infection by SARS-CoV-2. It is unknown whether therapeutic regimens to which these patients may have been subjected to in the months/years preceding the infection could be immunocompromising. Statins are among the most widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs. As competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA-reductase, the key enzyme of the “mevalonate pathway” through which essential compounds, not only cholesterol, are synthesized, statins decrease the levels of cholesterol, and thus LDLs, as an innate defense mechanism, with controversial results in decreasing mortality from cardiovascular disease. Moreover, statins have pleiotropic, mostly deleterious effects on many cell types, including immune cells. In the attempt to decipher the enigma of SARS-CoV-2 infectivology, the hypothesis should be tested whether the population of subjects who succumbed to Covid-19 may have developed a compromised immunity at sub-clinical levels and have become more susceptible to fatal consequences from SARS-Cov-2 infection due to statin therapy.
Impact of routine infant BCG vaccination in young generation on prevention of local COVID-19 spread in Japan;In Japan, the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was diagnosed on January 15, 2020 and subsequent infections rapidly increased. The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination program is the principal element of tuberculosis control in Japan. We investigated the impact of routine infant BCG vaccination on prevention of local COVID-19 spread.
SARS-CoV-2 shedding and seroconversion among passengers quarantined after disembarking a cruise ship: a case series;A cruise ship is a closed-off environment that simulates the basic functioning of a city in terms of living conditions and interpersonal interactions. Thus, the 
Satellite-detected tropospheric nitrogen dioxide and spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Northern Italy;Following the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) last December 2019 in China, Italy was the first European country to be severely affected, with the first local case diagnosed on 20 February 2020. The virus spread quickly, particularly in the North of Italy, with three regions (Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna) being the most severely affected. These three regions accounted for >80% of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases when the tight lockdown was established (March 8). These regions include one of Europe's areas of heaviest air pollution, the Po valley. Air pollution has been recently proposed as a possible risk factor of SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to its adverse effect on immunity and to the possibility that polluted air may even carry the virus. We investigated the association between air pollution and subsequent spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection within these regions. We collected NO
Association of inflammatory markers with the severity of COVID-19: A meta-analysis;Studies reported associations of inflammatory markers with the severity of COVID-19, but conclusions were inconsistent. We aimed to provide an overview of the association of inflammatory markers with the severity of COVID-19.
Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 among patients in the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre primary care network: a cross-sectional study;There are few primary care studies of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre primary care network.
Diagnostic accuracy of the FebriDx host response point-of-care test in patients hospitalised with suspected COVID-19;Management of the COVID-19 pandemic is hampered by long delays associated with centralised laboratory PCR testing. In hospitals this leads to poor patient flow and nosocomial transmission and so rapid, accurate diagnostic tests are urgently required. The FebriDx is a point-of-care test that detects an antiviral host response protein in finger prick blood within 10 min, but its accuracy for the identification of COVID-19 is unknown.
A potential therapeutic combination for treatment of COVID-19: Synergistic effect of DPP4 and RAAS suppression;COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is an abbreviated name for coronavirus disease 2019. COVID-19 became a global pandemic in early 2020. It predominantly affects not only the upper and lower respiratory tract, but also multiple organs, including the kidney, heart, and brain. The mortality of COVID-19 patients is high in men and in elderly patients with age-related diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. The angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), a component in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), plays as cell surface receptors for SARS-CoV-2. A recent study proved that coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 also uses dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4, also known as adenosine deaminase complexing protein 2, CD26) as a co-receptor when entering cells. In addition, DPP4 is also implicated in the regulation of the immune response. Thus, the combination of DPP4 inhibition and suppression of ACE-2/RAAS may be a novel therapeutic strategy for combating this pandemic.
Impact of building ventilation systems and habitual indoor incense burning on SARS-CoV-2 virus transmissions in Middle Eastern countries;Majority of countries across the globe have employed improving building ventilation, quarantine, social distancing, and disinfections as a general measure of preventing SARS-CoV-2 virus transmissions. However, arid Middle Eastern countries with hot climate (elevated outdoor temperature and humidity levels) are experiencing a different situation. Unfortunately, these harsh ambient climatic conditions in Middle Eastern countries make it impossible for most buildings to utilize natural/mechanical ventilation systems. Besides, indoor air temperatures of most buildings are very low due to overconsumption of air conditioning, thereby, it can be a potential factor of virus spread in most residential homes and public buildings. Most importantly, habitual indoor burning of incense which is the major source of coarse (PM
Snapshot PCR surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in hospital staff in England;Significant nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated. Understanding the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carriage amongst HCWs at work is necessary to inform the development of HCW screening programmes to control nosocomial spread.
Laboratory characteristics of patients infected with the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus;A subgroup of COVID-19 patients develop very severe disease with requirement for ICU treatment, ventilation, and ECMO therapy. Laboratory tests indicate that the immune and clotting system show marked alterations with hyper-activation, hyper-inflammation, cytokine storm development. Furthermore, organ-specific biomarkers demonstrate the involvement of cardiac muscle, kidney, and liver dysfunction in many patients. In this article the use of laboratory biomarkers is discussed with regard to their use for diagnosis, disease progression, and risk assessment.
Do superspreaders generate new superspreaders? A hypothesis to explain the propagation pattern of COVID-19;The current global propagation of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, with slow transmission continuing in many countries and exponential propagation in others, where the time that it took for the explosive spread to begin varied greatly. It is proposed that this could be explained by cascading superspreading events, in which new infections caused by a superspreader are more likely to be highly infectious. The mechanism suggested for this is related to viral loads. Exposure to high viral loads may result in high-intensity infection, which exposes new cases to high viral loads. This notion is supported by experimental veterinary research.
Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain (ENE-COVID): a nationwide, population-based seroepidemiological study;Spain is one of the European countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Serological surveys are a valuable tool to assess the extent of the epidemic, given the existence of asymptomatic cases and little access to diagnostic tests. This nationwide population-based study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain at national and regional level.
Rapid asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 during the incubation period demonstrating strong infectivity in a cluster of youngsters aged 16-23 years outside Wuhan and characteristics of young patients with COVID-19: A prospective contact-tracing study;The outbreak of coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread to many places outside Wuhan. Previous studies on COVID-19 mostly included older hospitalized-adults. Little information on infectivity among and characteristics of youngsters with COVID-19 is available.
;Pulmonary surfactant is considered to be one of the soaps. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the other enveloped viruses become very weak against surfactant. The SARS virus binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor and causes pneumonia. In the lung, the ACE2 receptor sits on the top of lung cells known as alveolar epithelial type II (AE2) cells. These cells play an important role in producing surfactant. Pulmonary surfactant is believed to regulate the alveolar surface tension in mammalian lungs. To our knowledge, AE2 cells are believed to act as immunoregulatory cells
Early characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak predict the subsequent epidemic scope;The mostly-resolved first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in China provided a unique opportunity to investigate how the initial characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak predict its subsequent magnitude.
Heat warning and public and workers' health at the time of COVID-19 pandemic;The humanity is currently facing the COVID-19 pandemic challenge, the largest global health emergency after the Second World War. During summer months, many countries in the northern hemisphere will also have to counteract an imminent seasonal phenomenon, the management of extreme heat events. The novelty this year concerns that the world population will have to deal with a new situation that foresees the application of specific measures, including adjunctive personal protective equipment (i.e. facemasks and gloves), in order to reduce the potential transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These measures should help to decrease the risk of the infection transmission but will also represent an aggravating factor to counteract the heat effects on the population health both at occupational and environmental level. The use of a specific heat health warning system with personalized information based on individual, behavioural and environmental characteristics represents a necessary strategy to help a fast adaptation of the population at a time where the priority is to live avoiding SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Management of a COVID-19 outbreak in a hotel in Tenerife, Spain;Since the first accounts of SARS-CoV-2, authorities have encountered numerous unprecedented situations threatening public health. This rapid communication addresses events that led to the quarantining of a hotel in Tenerife, Spain and the effectiveness of the rapidly implemented control measures. In total, eight cases have been associated with the hotel. Due to the international nature of the guests, had these timely precautions not been in place, a multinational cluster might have formed.
Is Colombia an example of successful containment of the COVID-19 2020 pandemic? A critical analysis of the epidemiological data. March to July 2020;Colombia detected its first COVID-19 case on March 2nd, 2020. From March 22nd to April 25th, it implemented a national lock down that, apparently, allowed the country to keep a low incidence and mortality rate up to mid-May. Forced by the economic losses the government opened many commercial activities, which was followed by an increase in cases and deaths. This paper presents a critical analysis of the Colombian surveillance data in order to identify strengths and pitfalls of the control measures.
B-cell engineering: A promising approach towards vaccine development for COVID-19;With the number of cases crossing six million (and more than three hundred and seventy thousand deaths) worldwide, there is a dire need of a vaccine (and repurposing of drugs) for SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19). It can be argued that a vaccine may be the most efficient way to contain the spread of this disease and prevent its future onset. While many attempts are being made to design and develop a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, pertinent technological hitches do exist. That is perhaps one of the reasons that we don’t have vaccine for coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-1 and MERS). Recently developed CRISPR-mediated genome editing approach can be repurposed into a cell-modification endeavor in addition to (and rather than) correcting defective parts of genome. With this premise, B-cells can be engineered into universal donor, antigen specific, perpetually viable, long lasting, non-oncogenic, relatively benign, antibody producing cells which may serve as an effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 and, by the same rationale, other viruses and pathogens.
Effect of meteorological parameters on spread of COVID-19 in India and air quality during lockdown;The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and has created a medical emergency worldwide. In India, it is already reported more than 855 thousand cases and more than 22 thousands deaths due to COVID-19 till July 12, 2020. The role of temperature, humidity, and absolute humidity in the transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been well established. In contrast, for the previous many viral infections like influenza, it is well established. Therefore the study to investigate the meteorological condition for incidence and spread of COVID-19 infection and to provide a scientific basis for prevention and control measures against the new disease is required for India. In this work, we analyze daily averaged meteorological data for the last three years (2017–2019) for March, April and May months and the same for the year 2020 for March 1 to May 31. We found a positive association between daily COVID-19 cases and temperature and a mixed association with relative and absolute humidity over India. We have investigated the association of aerosols (AOD) and other pollutions (NO
The index case of SARS-CoV-2 in Scotland;Since its identification in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has infected 125,048 persons globally with cases identified in 118 countries across all continents. We report on the Scottish index case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus causing COVID-19.
Risk-adapted Treatment Strategy For COVID-19 Patients;There are no clear expert consensus or guidelines on how to treat 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The objective of this study is to investigate the short-term effect of risk-adapted treatment strategy on patients with COVID-19.
Clinical progression of patients with COVID-19 in Shanghai, China;Studies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have generally been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial clinical characteristics. We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19.
Pernio-like skin lesions associated with COVID-19: A case series of 318 patients from 8 countries;Increasing evidence suggests pernio-like lesions are cutaneous manifestations of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19).
SARS – CoV-2: Reasons of epidemiology of severe ill disease cases and therapeutic approach using trivalent vaccine (tetanus, diphtheria and Bordetella pertussis);The novel coronavirus Covid-19 follows transmission route and clinical presentation of all community-acquired coronaviruses. Instead, the rate of transmission is significative higher, with a faster spread of the virus responsible of the worldwide outbreak and a significative higher mortality rate due to the development of a severe lung injury. Most noteworthy is the distribution of death rate among age groups. Children and younger people are almost protected from severe clinical presentation.
Possible environmental effects on the spread of COVID-19 in China;At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, designated as SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China and was identified as the causal pathogen of COVID-19. The epidemic scale of COVID-19 has increased dramatically, with confirmed cases increasing across China and globally. Understanding the potential affecting factors involved in COVID-19 transmission will be of great significance in containing the spread of the epidemic. Environmental and meteorological factors might impact the occurrence of COVID-19, as these have been linked to various diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), whose causative pathogens belong to the same virus family as SARS-CoV-2. We collected daily data of COVID-19 confirmed cases, air quality and meteorological variables of 33 locations in China for the outbreak period of 29 January 2020 to 15 February 2020. The association between air quality index (AQI) and confirmed cases was estimated through a Poisson regression model, and the effects of temperature and humidity on the AQI-confirmed cases association were analyzed. The results show that the effect of AQI on confirmed cases associated with an increase in each unit of AQI was statistically significant in several cities. The lag effect of AQI on the confirmed cases was statistically significant on lag day 1 (relative risk (RR) = 1.0009, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0004, 1.0013), day 2 (RR = 1.0007, 95% CI: 1.0003, 1.0012) and day 3 (RR = 1.0008, 95% CI: 1.0003, 1.0012). The AQI effect on the confirmed cases might be stronger in the temperature range of 10 °C ≤ 
SARS-CoV-2 and viral sepsis: observations and hypotheses;Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), clinicians have tried every effort to understand the disease, and a brief portrait of its clinical features have been identified. In clinical practice, we noticed that many severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients developed typical clinical manifestations of shock, including cold extremities and weak peripheral pulses, even in the absence of overt hypotension. Understanding the mechanism of viral sepsis in COVID-19 is warranted for exploring better clinical care for these patients. With evidence collected from autopsy studies on COVID-19 and basic science research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV, we have put forward several hypotheses about SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis after multiple rounds of discussion among basic science researchers, pathologists, and clinicians working on COVID-19. We hypothesise that a process called viral sepsis is crucial to the disease mechanism of COVID-19. Although these ideas might be proven imperfect or even wrong later, we believe they can provide inputs and guide directions for basic research at this moment.
Investigation of effective climatology parameters on COVID-19 outbreak in Iran;SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) Coronavirus cases are confirmed throughout the world and millions of people are being put into quarantine. A better understanding of the effective parameters in infection spreading can bring about a logical measurement toward COVID-19. The effect of climatic factors on spreading of COVID-19 can play an important role in the new Coronavirus outbreak. In this study, the main parameters, including the number of infected people with COVID-19, population density, intra-provincial movement, and infection days to end of the study period, average temperature, average precipitation, humidity, wind speed, and average solar radiation investigated to understand how can these parameters effects on COVID-19 spreading in Iran? The Partial correlation coefficient (PCC) and Sobol’-Jansen methods are used for analyzing the effect and correlation of variables with the COVID-19 spreading rate. The result of sensitivity analysis shows that the population density, intra-provincial movement have a direct relationship with the infection outbreak. Conversely, areas with low values of wind speed, humidity, and solar radiation exposure to a high rate of infection that support the virus's survival. The provinces such as Tehran, Mazandaran, Alborz, Gilan, and Qom are more susceptible to infection because of high population density, intra-provincial movements and high humidity rate in comparison with Southern provinces.
Diacerein: A potential multi-target therapeutic drug for COVID-19;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), was declared pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 binds its host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through the viral spike (S) protein. The mortality related to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in COVID-19 patients has been suggested to be connected with cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), an excessive immune response that severely damages healthy lung tissue. In addition, cardiac symptoms, including fulminant myocarditis, are frequent in patients in a severe state of illness. Diacerein (DAR) is an anthraquinone derivative drug whose active metabolite is rhein. Different studies have shown that this compound inhibits the IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, TNF-α, NF-κB and NALP3 inflammasome pathways. The antiviral activity of rhein has also been documented. This metabolite prevents hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and influenza A virus (IAV) adsorption and replication through mechanisms involving regulation of oxidative stress and alterations of the TLR4, Akt, MAPK, and NF-κB signalling pathways. Importantly, rhein inhibits the interaction between the SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting rhein as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of SARS-CoV infection. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that DAR is a multi-target drug useful for COVID-19 treatment. This anthraquinone may control hyperinflammatory conditions by multi-faceted cytokine inhibition and by reducing viral infection.
Acute cor pulmonale from saddle pulmonary embolism in a patient with previous COVID-19: should we prolong prophylactic anticoagulation?;Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is known to be associated with a heightened risk of thromboembolism. However, the risk associated with mild and moderate illness from COVID-19 is unknown, and there is no current recommendation for prophylaxis against thromboembolism in patients after hospital treatment, unless there are established thrombophilic risk factors. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman who presented with massive saddle pulmonary embolism 1 week after initial hospital discharge, which was treated successfully with thrombolysis. This case raises the question of whether extended prophylactic anticoagulation should be considered even in low-risk COVID-19 cases.
Mortality and pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection: an international cohort study;The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on postoperative recovery needs to be understood to inform clinical decision making during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reports 30-day mortality and pulmonary complication rates in patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Prior infection with intestinal coronaviruses moderates symptom severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19: A hypothesis and preliminary evidence;The pandemic of acute respiratory illness caused by the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, officially designated COVID-19, has attained the proportions of a global health crisis. Though all nations of the world have been affected by this disease, there have been marked cross-national variations in prevalence, severity and mortality rates. Various explanations, based on demographic, social and climatic factors, have been suggested to account for this variability, but these remain unverified to date. Based on recent research findings suggesting that human enterocytes may serve as a point of entry for SARS-CoV-2, leading to intestinal viral replication, this paper puts forward the hypothesis that prior intestinal infection with coronaviruses, either symptomatic or asymptomatic, may moderate this process and minimize the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This hypothesis is supported by evidence on the gastrointestinal manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and related infections, on the geographical patterns observed in the variability of COVID-19 mortality, and on the occurrence and geographical distribution of outbreaks of diarrheal disease, as well as asymptomatic infection, with human coronaviruses as verified by direct or serological testing. Preliminary supporting evidence based on national and international health statistics is presented, along with suggestions on more robust methods by which this hypothesis may be tested. If the proposal put forth in this paper can be confirmed either wholly or in part, it would have significant implications in terms of strategies aimed at minimizing the severity of COVID-19 in a clinical setting.
Nebulized Lidocaine in COVID-19, An Hypothesis;Coronavirus Diseases-2019 (COVID-19) has caused a large global outbreak and has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). It has been proposed that COVID-19-related hyperinflammation and dysregulated immune response might play a critical role in developing a cytokine storm which usually progresses to a life-threatening acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome in infected individuals. Lidocaine, a local analgesic and anti-arrhythmic, is known for its anti-inflammatory actions and has been used to reduce cough and improve respiratory symptoms in severe asthmatic patients. It has a demonstrated safety profile. It is proposed that nebulized lidocaine might be beneficial in reducing cytokines, protecting patients’ lungs and improving outcomes in COVID-19 patients when administered via inhalation as an adjunctive treatment for severe respiratory symptoms in patients fighting the novel Coronavirus. Additional investigation is warranted.
Factors Affecting Perceived Effectiveness of COVID-19 Prevention Measures among Filipino during Enhanced Community Quarantine in Luzon, Philippines: Integrating Protection Motivation Theory and Extended Theory of Planned Behavior;The current study integrated Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to evaluate factors affecting the perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 prevention measures among Filipino during Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) in Luzon, Philippines.
COVID-19 and Nigeria: putting the realities in context;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was previously known as 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The disease evolved into a serious global emergency, leading to its declaration as a pandemic.
What can we learn from a COVID-19 lung biopsy?;We reported a patient diagnosed with severe pneumonia from coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), and did the percutaneous lung biopsy with the guidance of ultrasound. Then we presented the patient's lung morphological, ultrastructure, and some important inflammatory biological markers changes, to help better understand the disease and make a clue for all the multidisciplinary team to save more people.
Clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 family clusters in Beijing, China;Since its discovery, SARS-CoV-2 has been spread throughout China before becoming a global pandemic. In Beijing, family clusters are the main mode of human-human transmission accounting for 57.6% of the total confirmed cases.
Wastewater surveillance for population-wide Covid-19: The present and future;The Covid-19 pandemic (Coronavirus disease 2019) continues to expose countless unanticipated problems at all levels of the world's complex, interconnected society — global domino effects involving public health and safety, accessible health care, food security, stability of economies and financial institutions, and even the viability of democracies. These problems pose immense challenges that can voraciously consume human and capital resources. Tracking the initiation, spread, and changing trends of Covid-19 at population-wide scales is one of the most daunting challenges, especially the urgent need to map the distribution and magnitude of Covid-19 in near real-time. Other than pre-exposure prophylaxis or therapeutic treatments, the most important tool is the ability to quickly identify infected individuals. The mainstay approach for epidemics has long involved the large-scale application of diagnostic testing at the individual case level. However, this approach faces overwhelming challenges in providing fast surveys of large populations.
High-resolution Chest CT Features and Clinical Characteristics of Patients Infected with COVID-19 in Jiangsu, China;A pneumonia associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recently emerged in China. It was recognized as a global health hazard.
Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Geneva, Switzerland (SEROCoV-POP): a population-based study;Assessing the burden of COVID-19 on the basis of medically attended case numbers is suboptimal given its reliance on testing strategy, changing case definitions, and disease presentation. Population-based serosurveys measuring anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) antibodies provide one method for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic. Here, we estimate weekly seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population of Geneva, Switzerland, during the epidemic.
Primary concentration – The critical step in implementing the wastewater based epidemiology for the COVID-19 pandemic: A mini-review;The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has posed a significant global public health threat and caused dramatic social and economic disruptions. A new research direction is attracting a significant amount of attention in the academic community of environmental sciences and engineering, in which rapid community-level monitoring could be achieved by applying the methodology of wastewater based epidemiology (WBE). Given the fact that the development of a mass balance on the total number of viral RNA copies in wastewater samples and the infected stool specimens is the heart of WBE, the result of the quantitative RNA detection in wastewater has to be highly sensitive, accurate, and reliable. Thus, applying effective concentration methods before the subsequent RNA extraction and RT-qPCR detection is a must-have procedure for the WBE. This review provides new insights into the primary concentration methods that have been adopted by the eighteen recently reported COVID-19 wastewater detection studies, along with a brief discussion of the mechanisms of the most commonly used virus concentration methods, including the PEG-based separation, electrostatically charged membrane filtration, and ultrafiltration. In the end, two easy and well-proven concentration strategies are recommended as below, aiming to maximize the practical significance and operational effectiveness of the SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration from wastewater samples.
The mortality and psychological burden caused by response to COVID-19 outbreak;The world is experiencing a severe COVID-19 outbreak. To control this outbreak, many governments in the world have imposed lockdown or quarantine measures. We hypothesize that these measures may cause additional mortality and morbidity in the (near) future due to delay in diagnosing diseases and other indirect effect on health (such as economic crisis).
Assessing the relationship between ground levels of ozone (O;This paper investigates the correlation between the high level of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection accelerated transmission and lethality, and surface air pollution in Milan metropolitan area, Lombardy region in Italy. For January–April 2020 period, time series of daily average inhalable gaseous pollutants ozone (O
Toilets dominate environmental detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in a hospital;Respiratory and fecal aerosols play confirmed and suspected roles, respectively, in transmitting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). An extensive environmental sampling campaign of both toilet and non-toilet environments was performed in a dedicated hospital building for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the associated environmental factors were analyzed. In total, 107 surface samples, 46 air samples, two exhaled condensate samples, and two expired air samples were collected within and beyond four three-bed isolation rooms. The data of the COVID-19 patients were collected. The building environmental design and the cleaning routines were reviewed. Field measurements of airflow and CO
COVID-19: NAD;The SARS-CoV-2 hyperinflammatory response is associated with high mortality. This hypothesis suggests that a deficiency of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD
Changes in air quality during the lockdown in Barcelona (Spain) one month into the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic;Lockdown measures came into force in Spain from March 14th, two weeks after the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, to reduce the epidemic curve. Our study aims to describe changes in air pollution levels during the lockdown measures in the city of Barcelona (NE Spain), by studying the time evolution of atmospheric pollutants recorded at the urban background and traffic air quality monitoring stations. After two weeks of lockdown, urban air pollution markedly decreased but with substantial differences among pollutants. The most significant reduction was estimated for BC and NO2 (−45 to −51%), pollutants mainly related to traffic emissions. A lower reduction was observed for PM10 (−28 to −31.0%). By contrast, O
Is macrophages heterogeneity important in determining COVID-19 lethality?;COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 has led to the death of thousands of adults worldwide. It is now clear that the hyper-inflammatory response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 plays a major role in disease severity and lethality of the infection. Macrophages are innate immune cells that sense and respond to infections by producing a plethora of inflammatory molecules and by interacting with other inflammatory cells. Therefore, macrophages may be diriment on eliminating pathogens and promoting organ repair. However, macrophages can be a major player of the so called 
Critical illness myopathy after COVID-19;We describe a patient who developed diffuse and symmetrical muscle weakness after a long stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The patient underwent a neurophysiological protocol, including nerve conduction studies, concentric needle electromyography (EMG) of the proximal and distal muscles, and direct muscle stimulation (DMS). Nerve conduction studies showed normal sensory conduction and low-amplitude compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs). EMG revealed signs of myopathy, which were more pronounced in the lower limbs. The post-DMS CMAP was absent in the quadriceps and of reduced amplitude in the tibialis anterior muscle. Based on these clinical and neurophysiological findings, a diagnosis of critical illness myopathy was made according to the current diagnostic criteria. Given the large number of patients with COVID-19 who require long ICU stays, many of these patients are very likely to develop ICU-acquired weakness, as did the patient described here. Health systems must plan to provide adequate access to rehabilitative facilities for both pulmonary and motor rehabilitative treatment after COVID-19.
Cross-immunity between respiratory coronaviruses may limit COVID-19 fatalities;Of the seven coronaviruses associated with disease in humans, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cause considerable mortality but also share significant sequence homology, and potentially antigenic epitopes capable of inducing an immune response. The degree of similarity is such that perhaps prior exposure to one virus could confer partial immunity to another. Indeed, data suggests a considerable amount of cross-reactivity and recognition by the hosts immune response between different coronavirus infections. While the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak rapidly overwhelmed medical facilities of particularly Europe and North America, accounting for 78% of global deaths, only 8% of deaths have occurred in Asia where the outbreak originated. Interestingly, Asia and the Middle East have previously experienced multiple rounds of coronavirus infections, perhaps suggesting buildup of acquired immunity to the causative SARS-CoV-2 that underlies COVID-19. This article hypothesizes that a causative factor underlying such low morbidity in these regions is perhaps (at least in part) due to acquired immunity from multiple rounds of coronavirus infections and discusses the mechanisms and recent evidence to support such assertions. Further investigations of such phenomenon would allow us to examine strategies to confer protective immunity, perhaps aiding vaccine development.
Estrogen shields women from COVID-19 complications by reducing ER stress;Estrogen hormone acts as a potential key player in providing immunity against certain viral infection. It is found to be associated in providing immunity against acute lungs inflammation and influenza virus by modulating cytokines storm and mediating adaptive immune alterations respectively. Women are less affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection because of the possible influence of estrogen hormone as compared to men. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 causes stress in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which in turn aggravates the infection, estrogen hormone might play key role in decreasing ER stress by activating estrogen mediated signaling pathways, results in unfolded protein response (UPR). Estrogen governs degradation of phosphotidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP
;A characteristic feature of COVID-19 disease is lymphopenia. Lymphopenia occurs early in the clinical course and is a predictor of disease severity and outcomes. The mechanism of lymphopenia in COVID-19 is uncertain. It has been variously attributed to the release of inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-α
Can hyperimmune anti-CMV globulin substitute for convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19?;Information on treatment of COVID-19 infection in renal transplant recipients is scarce, especially in symptomatic patients and patients with recent major clinical events. This group of patients suffers from different opportunistic infections which may coexist with COVID-19. Currently available expert opinions suggest reduction of immunosuppression therapy for renal transplant recipients with symptomatic COVID-19 infection with either antiviral drugs, hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin. Inspired by our experience in treatment of CMV pneumonia and literature data on the potential benefit of convalescent plasma for treatment of different viral diseases we suggest use of the hyperimmune anti-CMV gamma globulins in addition to other available therapies. Besides the immunosuppression reduction which is supposed to be beneficial, immunoglobulins with their immunomodulatory effects and possible antiviral role, may increase a possibility for favorable outcome.
Investigation of a COVID-19 outbreak in Germany resulting from a single travel-associated primary case: a case series;In December, 2019, the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, causing COVID-19, a respiratory disease presenting with fever, cough, and often pneumonia. WHO has set the strategic objective to interrupt spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. An outbreak in Bavaria, Germany, starting at the end of January, 2020, provided the opportunity to study transmission events, incubation period, and secondary attack rates.
It is time to drop hydroxychloroquine from our COVID-19 armamentarium;Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were among the first drugs repurposed for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A few in vitro studies confirmed that both drugs exhibited dose dependent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities. These observations and the encouraging results from early poorly conducted observational studies created a major hype about the therapeutic potential of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 disease. This was further catalyzed by media and political influences leading to a widespread use of these agents. Subsequent randomized trials revealed lack of efficacy of these agents in improving the outcomes of COVID-19 or in preventing infection in post-exposure prophylaxis studies. Nevertheless, many ongoing trials continue to actively recruit tens of thousands of patients to receive HCQ worldwide. In this perspective, we address the possible mechanisms behind the lack of efficacy and the increased risk of cardiac toxicity of HCQ in COVID-19 disease. For the lack of efficacy, we discuss the fundamental differences of treatment initiation between in vitro and in vivo studies, the pitfalls of the pharmacological calculations of effective blood drug concentrations and related dosing regimens, and the possible negative effect of HCQ on the antiviral type-I interferon response. Although it has been repeatedly claimed that HCQ has a longstanding safety track record for many decades in use, we present counterarguments for this contention due to disease-drug and drug-drug interactions. We discuss the molecular mechanisms and the cumulative epidemiological evidence of HCQ cardiac toxicity.
Clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reactivation;Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population. However, limited data was available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reactivation. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.
Risk of COVID-19 in health-care workers in Denmark: an observational cohort study;Health-care workers are thought to be highly exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in health-care workers and the proportion of seroconverted health-care workers with previous symptoms of COVID-19.
The Costs of an Expanded Screening Criteria for COVID-19: A Modelling Study;Nosocomial infection is an ongoing concern in the COVID-19 outbreak. The effective screening of suspected cases in the healthcare setting is therefore necessary, enabling the early identification and prompt isolation of cases for epidemic containment. We aimed to assess the cost and health outcomes of an extended screening strategy, implemented in Singapore on 07 February 2020, which maximizes case identification in the public healthcare system.
Why do children seem to be more protected against COVID-19? A hypothesis;Today it remains unclear why children seem to be less likely to get infected by COVID-19 or why they appear to be less symptomatic after infections. All individuals, especially children, are exposed to various viruses including human coronavirus (CoVs) that can generally lead to respiratory infections. We hypothesize that recurrent CoVs exposure may induce an effective antiviral B and T-cell-mediated adaptive immune response, which could also be protective against COVID-19. Based on the high-homology between the Spike protein epitopes of taxonomically-related coronaviruses, we theorize that past/recurrent contact with CoVs might shield children also against the circulating COVID-19 through a possible neutralizing antibody response previously CoVs-induced. This would open up possible lines of research for the development of live-attenuated virus vaccines from CoVs. Future research is desirable to confirm or disprove such hypothesis.
Vitamin D3 and K2 and their potential contribution to reducing the COVID-19 mortality rate;The world is desperately seeking for a sustainable solution to combat the coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Recent research indicated that optimizing Vitamin D blood levels could offer a solution approach that promises a heavily reduced fatality rate as well as solving the public health problem of counteracting the general vitamin D deficiency. This paper dived into the immunoregulatory effects of supplementing Vitamin D
Epidemiological and clinical features of 125 Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in Fuyang, Anhui, China;To investigate the epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID-19 in Anhui province of China.
The effects of allium sativum on immunity within the scope of COVID-19 infection;The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infection is quite variable and the manifestations varies from asymptomatic disease to severe acute respiratory infection. Fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, loss of appetite, olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are the most prevalent general symptoms. Decreased immune system cells such as suppressed regulatory T cells, cytotoxic and helper T cells, natural killer cells, monocytes/macrophages and increased proinflammatory cytokines are the characteristic features. Compounds derived from Allium sativum (garlic) have the potential to decrease the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and to reverse the immunological abnormalities to more acceptable levels. Allium sativum is suggested as a beneficial preventive measure before being infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 virus.
Observations of the global epidemiology of COVID-19 from the prepandemic period using web-based surveillance: a cross-sectional analysis;Background
Severe air pollution links to higher mortality in COVID-19 patients: The “double-hit” hypothesis.;In areas of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak worldwide mean air pollutants concentrations vastly exceed the maximum limits. Chronic exposure to air pollutants have been associated with lung ACE-2 over-expression which is known to be the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between air pollutants concentration (PM 2.5 and NO2) and COVID-19 outbreak, in terms of transmission, number of patients, severity of presentation and number of deaths.
;The number of COVID-19 patients is dramatically increasing worldwide. Treatment in intensive care units (ICU) has become a major challenge
Clinical analysis of ten pregnant women with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A retrospective study;COVID-19 is spreading globally. This study aims to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women confirmed with COVID-19 to provide reference for clinical work.
COVID-19 and anosmia in Tehran, Iran;Patients with acute olfactory disorders typically present to the otolaryngologist with both acute hyposmia and less often with anosmia. With the onset of COVID-19 we have noticed an increase in the number of patients who have presented with new onset of complete smell loss to the senior author’s practice in Tehran, Iran. This anosmia and the frequency with which patients present is highly unusual. Coronaviruses have been known to cause common cold symptoms. COVID-19 infections have been described as causing more severe respiratory infections and the symptoms reported by authors from Wuhan, China have not specifically included anosmia. We describe patients who have presented during a two-week period of the COVID-19 pandemic with complete loss of sense of smell. Most had either no symptoms or mild respiratory symptoms. Many had a normal otolaryngologic exam. A relationship between COVID-19 and anosmia should be considered during the pandemic. We hypothesize that the mechanism of injury is similar to that of other coronavirus infections that cause central and peripheral neurologic deficits.
Low-Dose Subcutaneous Tocilizumab to Prevent Disease Progression in Patients with Moderate COVID-19 Pneumonia and Hyperinflammation;The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy profile of low-dose tocilizumab (TCZ) administered subcutaneously to patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammation to prevent disease progression.
Restructured society and environment: A review on potential technological strategies to control the COVID-19 pandemic;The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China at December 2019 had led to a global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the disease started to spread all over the world and became an international public health issue. The entire humanity has to fight in this war against the unexpected and each and every individual role is important. Healthcare system is doing exceptional work and the government is taking various measures that help the society to control the spread. Public, on the other hand, coordinates with the policies and act accordingly in most state of affairs. But the role of technologies in assisting different social bodies to fight against the pandemic remains hidden. The intention of our study is to uncover the hidden roles of technologies that ultimately help for controlling the pandemic. On investigating, it is found that the strategies utilizing potential technologies would yield better benefits and these technological strategies can be framed either to control the pandemic or to support the confinement of the society during pandemic which in turn aids in controlling the spreading of infection. This study enlightens the various implemented technologies that assists the healthcare systems, government and public in diverse aspects for fighting against COVID-19. Furthermore, the technological swift that happened during the pandemic and their influence in the environment and society is discussed. Besides the implemented technologies, this work also deals with untapped potential technologies that have prospective applications in controlling the pandemic circumstances. Alongside the various discussion, our suggested solution for certain situational issues is also presented.
Spatial analysis and GIS in the study of COVID-19. A review;This study entailed a review of 63 scientific articles on geospatial and spatial-statistical analysis of the geographical dimension of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The diversity of themes identified in this paper can be grouped into the following categories of disease mapping: spatiotemporal analysis, health and social geography, environmental variables, data mining, and web-based mapping. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 is essential for its mitigation, as it helps to clarify the extent and impact of the pandemic and can aid decision making, planning and community action. Health geography highlights the interaction of public health officials, affected actors and first responders to improve estimations of disease propagation and likelihoods of new outbreaks. Attempts at interdisciplinary correlation examine health policy interventions for the siting of health/sanitary services and controls, mapping/tracking of human movement, formulation of appropriate scientific and political responses and projection of spatial diffusion and temporal trends. This review concludes that, to fight COVID-19, it is important to face the challenges from an interdisciplinary perspective, with proactive planning, international solidarity and a global perspective. This review provides useful information and insight that can support future bibliographic queries, and also serves as a resource for understanding the evolution of tools used in the management of this major global pandemic of the 21 Century. It is hoped that its findings will inspire new reflections on the COVID-19 pandemic by readers.
Revisiting ‘;COVID-19 has emerged as a global health threat. The catastrophic reaction to a pandemic in spite of knowing the deadly outcomes, has been referred to as the 'social absurdity’. Such reaction creates a negativistic outlook with regard to the infection, thus contributing to chaos and preventing containment. In this article, the current pandemic of COVID-19 is revisited through the lens of Camus' ‘La Peste, 1947′. The philosophical roots of social ‘absurdity’ during a pandemic are critically discussed in the context of death anxiety. Subsequently, ways of reshaping it are highlighted, borrowing from the theories of existentialism and positive psychology.
Association between short-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 infection: Evidence from China;The novel coronavirus pneumonia, namely COVID-19, has become a global public health problem. Previous studies have found that air pollution is a risk factor for respiratory infection by carrying microorganisms and affecting body's immunity. This study aimed to explore the relationship between ambient air pollutants and the infection caused by the novel coronavirus. Daily confirmed cases, air pollution concentration and meteorological variables in 120 cities were obtained from January 23, 2020 to February 29, 2020 in China. We applied a generalized additive model to investigate the associations of six air pollutants (PM
Are night shift workers at an increased risk for COVID-19?;Recent data has revealed an association between coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) incidence and seasonally regulated androgen sensitivity. This potential relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and clock genes, coupled with previously reported effects of night shift work on health, leads us to hypothesize that night shift workers may be at an increased physiological risk of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).
Targeting adenosinergic pathway and adenosine A;The most serious health issue today is the rapid outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). More than 6,973,427 confirmed cases were diagnosed in nearly 213 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances, causing globally over 400,000 deaths. Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients have been identified, but the factors influencing the immune system against COVID-19 have not been well established. Upon infection or cell damage, high amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are released from damaged cells, which serve as mediators of inflammation through purinergic cell surface receptor signaling. As a protective mechanism to prevent excessive damage to host tissue, adenosine counteracts ATP's effects by adenosine receptor stimulation to suppress the pro-inflammatory response. Adenosine is seen as a major obstacle to the efficacy of immune therapies, and the adenosinergic axis components are critical therapeutic targets for cancer and microbial infections. Pharmacologic inhibitors or antibodies specific to adenosinergic pathway components or adenosine receptors in microbial and tumor therapy have shown efficacy in pre-clinical studies and are entering the clinical arena. In this review, we provide a novel hypothesis explaining the potential for improving the efficiency of innate and adaptive immune systems by targeting adenosinergic pathway components and adenosine A
Are online searches for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) related to media or epidemiology? A cross-sectional study;Previous studies on the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) have found strong correlations between online searches and the epidemiology of the disease.
The role of testing in the fight against COVID-19: Current happenings in Africa and the way forward;The dramatic increase in suspected COVID-19 cases in Africa has placed an enormous burden on public and private clinical facilities. To date, the most commonly used method for identifying and confirming the virus is the laboratory-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Unfortunately, testing capacities have been limited in many parts of Africa because of inadequate test kits, which have restricted scaling up beyond the few public health laboratories at designated locations. In this mini-review, we present Africa's preparedness and readiness for testing, why testing is crucial, the need to immediately strengthen existing facilities, and what it involves as part of combined approaches for managing the COVID-19 crisis. The review highlights the urgent need for speedy expansion and distribution of several laboratory testing platforms, including real-time PCR and serological assays to both public health facilities and fully accredited private clinical laboratories.
;Counterproductive lung inflammation and dysregulated thrombosis contribute importantly to the lethality of advanced COVID-19. Adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR), expressed by a wide range of immune cells, as well as endothelial cells and platelets, exert cAMP-mediated anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects that potentially could be highly protective in this regard. The venerable drug pentoxifylline (PTX) exerts both anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects that reflect its ability to boost the responsiveness of A2AR to extracellular adenosine. The platelet-stabilizing drug dipyridamole (DIP) blocks intracellular uptake of extracellularly-generated adenosine, thereby up-regulating A2AR signaling in a way that should be functionally complementary to the impact of PTX in that regard. Moreover, DIP has recently been reported to slow the cellular replication of SARS-CoV-2 in clinically feasible concentrations. Both PTX and DIP are reasonably safe, well-tolerated, widely available, and inexpensive drugs. When COVID-19 patients can be treated within several days of symptom onset, using PTX + DIP in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and an antibiotic – azithromycin (AZM) or doxycycline – might be warranted. HCQ and AZM can suppress SARS-CoV-2 proliferation in vitro and may slow the cell-to-cell spread of the virus
Effects of temperature variation and humidity on the death of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China;Meteorological parameters are the important factors influencing the infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza. This study aims to explore the association between Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths and weather parameters. In this study, we collected the daily death numbers of COVID-19, meteorological parameters and air pollutant data from 20 January 2020 to 29 February 2020 in Wuhan, China. Generalized additive model was applied to explore the effect of temperature, humidity and diurnal temperature range on the daily death counts of COVID-19. There were 2299 COVID-19 death counts in Wuhan during the study period. A positive association with COVID-19 daily death counts was observed for diurnal temperature range (r = 0.44), but negative association for relative humidity (r = −0.32). In addition, one unit increase in diurnal temperature range was only associated with a 2.92% (95% CI: 0.61%, 5.28%) increase in COVID-19 deaths in lag 3. However, both 1 unit increase of temperature and absolute humidity were related to the decreased COVID-19 death in lag 3 and lag 5, with the greatest decrease both in lag 3 [−7.50% (95% CI: −10.99%, −3.88%) and −11.41% (95% CI: −19.68%, −2.29%)]. In summary, this study suggests the temperature variation and humidity may also be important factors affecting the COVID-19 mortality.
Role of a habitat's air humidity in Covid-19 mortality;Transient local over-dry environment might be a contributor and an explanation for the observed asynchronous local rises in Covid-19 mortality. We propose that a habitat's air humidity negatively correlate with Covid-19 morbidity and mortality, and support this hypothesis on the example of publicly available data from German federal states.
;The COVID-19 pandemic has not spared any continent. The disease has affected more than 7,500,000 individuals globally and killed approximately 450,000 individuals. The disease is caused by a very small virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus with a spike-like structure on its envelope that can interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor after cleavage. ACE2 receptors are present in the human lungs and other organs. SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus that belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus
COVID-19 and the environment: A critical review and research agenda;The current Coronavirus infection (COVID-19) outbreak has had a substantial impact on many aspects of general life. Although a number of studies have been published on the topic already, there has not been a critical review of studies on the impacts of COVID-19 by and on environmental factors. The current study fills this gap by presenting a critical analysis of 57 studies on the nexus between COVID-19 and the environment, published in nine journals up to May 2020. Majority of the studies in our sample are published in 
Effect of a wet market on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission dynamics in China, 2019–2020;The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) originating from Wuhan spread rapidly throughout China. While its origin remains uncertain, accumulating evidence links a wet market with the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to be investigated.
;Data are limited on the viral load, viral shedding patterns, and potential infectivity of asymptomatic patients (APs) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study included 31 adult patients who were virologically confirmed to have COVID-19 but were asymptomatic on admission. Among these 31 patients, 22 presented symptoms after admission and were defined as asymptomatic patients in the incubation period (APIs)
Reflection on lower rates of COVID-19 in children: Does childhood immunizations offer unexpected protection?;The incidence of COVID-19 in children and teenagers is only about 2% in China. Children had mild symptoms and hardly infected other children or adults. It is worth considering that children are the most vulnerable to respiratory pathogens, but fatal SARS-like virus had not caused severe cases among them. According to the pathological studies of COVID-19 and SARS, a sharp decrease in T lymphocytes leads to the breakdown of the immune system. The cellular immune system of children differs from that of adults may be the keystone of atypical clinical manifestations or even covert infection. The frequent childhood vaccinations and repeated pathogens infections might be resulting in trained immunity of innate immune cells, immune fitness of adaptive immune cells or cross-protection of antibodies in the children. Therefore, due to lack of specific vaccine, some vaccines for tuberculosis, influenza and pneumonia may have certain application potential for the front-line health workers in the prevention and control of COVID-19. However, for high-risk susceptible populations, such as the elderly with basic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, it is necessary to explore the remedial effect of the planned immune process on their immunity to achieve the trained immunity or immune fitness, so as to improve their own antiviral ability.
Temperature and precipitation associate with Covid-19 new daily cases: A correlation study between weather and Covid-19 pandemic in Oslo, Norway;This study aims to analyze the correlation between weather and covid-19 pandemic in the capital city of Norway, Oslo. This study employed a secondary data analysis of covid-19 surveillance data from the Norwegian public health institute and weather data from the Norwegian Meteorological institute. The components of weather include minimum temperature (°C), maximum temperature (°C), temperature average (°C), normal temperature (°C), precipitation level (mm) and wind speed (m/s). Since normality was not fulfilled, a non-parametric correlation test was used for data analysis. Maximum temperature (
Is there a role for insulin-like growth factor inhibition in the treatment of COVID-19-related adult respiratory distress syndrome?;Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of death associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. IGF-1 has been implicated in ARDS, yet its role in relation to COVID-19-related lung injury has not been investigated. We hypothesize that blockage of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) mitigates lung injury and decreases the risk of death in patients COVID-19-related ARDS. Patients with fibroproliferative ARDS have been shown to have increased IGF-1 and IGF-1R staining in lung tissue specimens. Rising levels of IGF-1 in bronchioalveolar fluid (BAL) and increased IGF-1 mRNA expression in lung tissues (but declining serum IGF-1 levels) have been found in late stage ARDS compared with early lung injury. Blockage of IGF-1R decreases lung tissue damage and increases survival in bleomycin-induced as well as H1N1 influenza-related lung injury in animal models. Teprotumumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the IGF-1R that was FDA-approved in 2020 for the treatment of Graves’ orbitopathy. In order to determine if teprotumumab may reduce lung injury and death related to ARDS in the setting of COVID-19, preliminary clinical data is needed. IGF-1 levels in serum and BAL fluid must be measured in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS. Histopathology from lung samples from patients with COVID-19-related ARDS must be examined for increased expression of the IGF-1R. Once these are ascertained, and if the data support IGF-1 involvement, a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2A trial of teprotumumab therapy in the setting of COVID-19-related ARDS and non-COVID-19-related ARDS designed to generate initial data on short-term efficacy, safety, dosing and administration should be performed.
Is anosmia the price to pay in an immune-induced scorched-earth policy against COVID-19?;Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), loss of smell has increasingly been reported as a frequent clinical sign. Understanding the underlying mechanism and the prognostic value of this symptom will help better manage patients. SARS-CoV-2, as SARS-CoV-1, may likely spread to the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory nerve, a known gateway for respiratory neurotropic viruses. We hypothesise that sudden loss of smell due to COVID-19 is the consequence of a protective host defence mechanism involving apoptosis of olfactory receptor neurons. Sacrificing smelling over neuroprotection is a logical strategy, even more so as olfaction is the only sense with the ability to regenerate in adults. Induced apoptosis of olfactory neurons has been shown in mice, successfully preventing neuroinvasion. On the other hand, adult olfactory neurogenesis has been shown to be regulated in part by the immune system, allowing to restore olfactory function. Understanding anosmia as part of a defence mechanism would support the concept of sudden anosmia as being a positive prognostic factor in the short term. Also, it may orient research to investigate the risk of future neurodegenerative disease linked to persisting coronavirus in neurons.
Increased Complement Receptor-3 levels in monocytes and granulocytes distinguish COVID-19 patients with pneumonia from those with mild symptoms;The reasons why some patients with COVID-19 develop pneumonia and others do not are unclear. To better understand this, we used multiparameter flow cytometry to profile circulating leukocytes from non-immunocompromised adult patients with PCR-proven COVID-19 and specifically compared those with mild symptoms with those who had developed pneumonia.
;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic and international health emergency by the World Health Organization. Patients with obesity with COVID-19 are 7 times more likely to need invasive mechanical ventilation than are patients without obesity (OR 7.36
SARS-CoV-2 and the sympathetic immune response: Dampening inflammation with antihypertensive drugs (Clonidine and Propranolol);Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now a pandemic with the United States now carrying the highest number of cases and fatalities. Although vaccines and antiviral agents are the main focus of therapy, here we present a plausible hypothesis to leverage our understanding of neuroimmunomodulation to intervene in the pathophysiology of the disease to prevent death.
Aberrant hyperactivation of cytotoxic T-cell as a potential determinant of COVID-19 severity;We hypothesized that immune response may contribute to progression of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) at the second week of illness. Therefore, we compared cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses between severe and mild COVID-19 cases.
Clinical and CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia: Focus on pregnant women and children;The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia is globally concerning. We aimed to investigate the clinical and CT features in the pregnant women and children with this disease, which have not been well reported.
Comparing COVID-19 and the 1918–19 influenza pandemics in the United Kingdom;We compared the COVID-19 and 1918–19 influenza pandemics in the United Kingdom. We found that the ongoing COVID-19 wave of infection matched the major wave of the 1918–19 influenza pandemic surprisingly well, with both reaching similar magnitudes (in terms of estimated weekly new infections) and spending the same duration with over five cases per 1000 inhabitants over the previous two months. We also discussed the similarities in epidemiological characteristics between these two pandemics.
Using a diagnostic model based on routine laboratory tests to distinguish patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 from those infected with influenza virus;The differential diagnosis between novel coronavirus pneumonia patients (NCPP) and influenza patients (IP) remains a challenge in clinical practice.
A potentially effective treatment for COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis of convalescent plasma therapy in treating severe infectious disease;Convalescent plasma (CP) has been used successfully to treat many types of infectious disease, and has shown initial effects in the treatment of the emerging 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, its curative effects and feasibility have yet to be confirmed by formal evaluation and well-designed clinical trials. To explore the effectiveness of treatment and predict the potential effects of CP with COVID-19, studies of different types of infectious disease treated with CP were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis.
Chilblain-like acral lesions during the COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID toes”): Histologic, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemical study of 17 cases;During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, several acral chilblain-like lesions were observed in young patients with suspected, but mostly unconfirmed, infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The histopathologic aspect of these lesions is as yet poorly known.
COVID-19 as a viral functional ACE2 deficiency disorder with ACE2 related multi-organ disease;SARS-CoV-2, the agent of COVID-19, shares a lineage with SARS-CoV-1, and a common fatal pulmonary profile but with striking differences in presentation, clinical course, and response to treatment. In contrast to SARS-CoV-1 (SARS), COVID-19 has presented as an often bi-phasic, multi-organ pathology, with a proclivity for severe disease in the elderly and those with hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Whilst death is usually related to respiratory collapse, autopsy reveals multi-organ pathology. Chronic pulmonary disease is underrepresented in the group with severe COVID-19. A commonality of aberrant renin angiotensin system (RAS) is suggested in the at-risk group. The identification of angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor allowing viral entry to cells precipitated our interest in the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathogenesis.
Prediction for the spread of COVID-19 in India and effectiveness of preventive measures;The spread of COVID-19 in the whole world has put the humanity at risk. The resources of some of the largest economies are stressed out due to the large infectivity and transmissibility of this disease. Due to the growing magnitude of number of cases and its subsequent stress on the administration and health professionals, some prediction methods would be required to predict the number of cases in future. In this paper, we have used data-driven estimation methods like long short-term memory (LSTM) and curve fitting for prediction of the number of COVID-19 cases in India 30 days ahead and effect of preventive measures like social isolation and lockdown on the spread of COVID-19. The prediction of various parameters (number of positive cases, number of recovered cases, etc.) obtained by the proposed method is accurate within a certain range and will be a beneficial tool for administrators and health officials.
;The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic disease (COVID-19) that has spread globally causing more than 30,000 deaths. Despite the immense and ongoing global effort, no efficacious drugs to fight this plague have been identified and patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), for respiratory distress, are managed mostly by means of supportive care based on oxygen maintenance. Several authors have reported that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities were indeed frequent among patients with COVID-19, which suggests that these conditions are likely to aggravate and complicate the prognosis. What the aforementioned diseases have in common is a latent chronic inflammatory state that may be associated with the alteration of laboratory parameters that are typical of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. In severe COVID-19 patients laboratory markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, D-dimer, serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase are elevated in many patients
Platelets to surrogate lung inflammation in COVID-19 patients;The neoteric severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been jeopardizing the world with the symptoms of seasonal flu. The virus contagion predicted to have been originated from Wuhan, China has by far trapped 4,198,418 cases from 212 countries in the world with two international conveyances with 284,102 deaths as of 11 May 2020 (10:18 GMT). Researchers around the globe have indulged in deciphering viral mode in the body for devising a cure. Affirmations from autopsies and preliminary findings on SARS-CoV-2 hypothesized on viral pathogenesis within the host, for instance, source of inflammation in lungs and pneumonia. This hypothesis assigns the platelets as agents of infection after viral entry. Presently, curbing infection to stall the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the prima facie intervention employed, worldwide. However, public health authorities must monitor the state of affairs scrupulously, as the deeper our understanding of this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can deal with it. Knowing this idea might be far-fetched, yet this postulate would serve as the groundwork for the present situation.
Air quality status during 2020 Malaysia Movement Control Order (MCO) due to 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-;An outbreak of respiratory illness which is proven to be infected by a 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-
Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study;Since Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.
Was school closure effective in mitigating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? Time series analysis using Bayesian inference;The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is causing significant damage to many nations. For mitigating its risk, Japan called on all elementary, junior high, and high schools nationwide to close beginning March 1, 2020. However, its effectiveness in decreasing the disease burden has not been investigated.
;In the wake of the recent pandemic of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with confirmed cases having crossed 750,000, health systems across the world are getting overwhelmed
Does COVID-19 infection impact on the trend of seasonal influenza infection? 11 countries and regions, from 2014 to 2020;Infection due to the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is dramatically widespread around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic could increase public concern to prevent infectious disease. The present study aimed to assess the relationship between the COVID-19 epidemic and the potential decrease in seasonal influenza cases.
Chinese mental health burden during the COVID-19 pandemic;We aimed to assess the Chinese mental health burden during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from 7,236 participants assessed with anxiety disorders, depressive symptoms, and poor sleep . The overall prevalence of anxiety disorders, depressive symptoms, sleep quality were 35.1%, 20.1%, 18.2%, respectively. Younger people reported a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders and depressive symptoms than older people (
Suppressed T cell-mediated immunity in patients with COVID-19: A clinical retrospective study in Wuhan, China;An ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has exhibited significant threats around the world. We found a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subsets and an increase of inflammatory cytokines of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in clinical practice.
Does infection of 2019 novel coronavirus cause acute and/or chronic sialadenitis?;2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is widespread in China and other countries. The target of 2019-nCoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) positive cells. ACE2 is present in the salivary gland duct epithelium, and thus it could be the target of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-related animal model experiments show that it can infect the epithelial cells on the salivary gland duct in Chinese rhesus macaques by targeting ACE2. Clinical studies confirmed that 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV could be detected in saliva of human patients. We hypothesize that the infection of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV will lead to inflammatory pathological lesions in patients’ target organs, and possibly inflammatory lesions in salivary glands. 2019-nCoV may cause acute sialoadenitis in the acute phase of infection. After the acute phase, chronic sialoadenitis may be caused by fibrosis repairment. Although there was no direct evidence to prove this, the available indirect evidence indicates a high probability of our hypothesis.
Could nutritional and functional status serve as prognostic factors for COVID-19 in the elderly?;Geriatric patients seem to be the most vulnerable group in COVID-19. These patients are usually characterized by impaired mobilization and malnutrition. In addition, obesity has been correlated with increased mortality rates after COVID-19 infection, highlighting the role of nutrition in prognosis of COVID-19 as well. In the past, several indices of nutritional status (GNRI) and functional status (ECOG performance status, Barthel Index, Handgrip Strength) have demonstrated a prognostic ability for hospitalized patients with influenza-like respiratory infections from coronavirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza and rhinovirus. Our hypothesis suggests that the previously mentioned nutritional and functional status indices, combined with the pneumonia severity index (CRB-65), could be useful in prognosis of morbidity and mortality of the elderly after the novel COVID-19 infection. Our hypothesis, is the first in the literature, which suggests a prognostic association between nutritional status of patients and COVID-19 infection, offering a quick and low-cost prognostic tool for COVID-19 in the elderly.
Comparative infection modeling and control of COVID-19 transmission patterns in China, South Korea, Italy and Iran;The COVID-19 has become a pandemic. The timing and nature of the COVID-19 pandemic response and control varied among the regions and from one country to the other, and their role in affecting the spread of the disease has been debated. The focus of this work is on the early phase of the disease when control measures can be most effective. We proposed a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed model (SEIR) model based on temporal moving windows to quantify COVID-19 transmission patterns and compare the temporal progress of disease spread in six representative regions worldwide: three Chinese regions (Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang) vs. three countries (South Korea, Italy and Iran). It was found that in the early phase of COVID-19 spread the disease follows a certain empirical law that is common in all regions considered. Simulations of the imposition of strong social distancing measures were used to evaluate the impact that these measures might have had on the duration and severity of COVID-19 outbreaks in the three countries. Measure-dependent transmission rates followed a modified normal distribution (empirical law) in the three Chinese regions. These rates responded quickly to the launch of the 1
Effects of meteorological conditions and air pollution on COVID-19 transmission: Evidence from 219 Chinese cities;The spatial distribution of the COVID-19 infection in China cannot be explained solely by geographical distance and regulatory stringency. In this research we investigate how meteorological conditions and air pollution, as concurring factors, impact COVID-19 transmission, using data on new confirmed cases from 219 prefecture cities from January 24 to February 29, 2020. Results revealed a kind of nonlinear dose-response relationship between temperature and coronavirus transmission. We also found that air pollution indicators are positively correlated with new confirmed cases, and the coronavirus further spreads by 5–7% as the AQI increases by 10 units. Further analysis based on regional divisions revealed that in northern China the negative effects of rising temperature on COVID-19 is counteracted by aggravated air pollution. In the southern cities, the ambient temperature and air pollution have a negative interactive effect on COVID-19 transmission, implying that rising temperature restrains the facilitating effects of air pollution and that they jointly lead to a decrease in new confirmed cases. These results provide implications for the control and prevention of this disease and for the anticipation of another possible pandemic.
Three novel prevention, diagnostic, and treatment options for COVID-19 urgently necessitating controlled randomized trials;Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infection with COVID-19 can result in silent transmission to large numbers of individuals, resulting in expansion of the pandemic with a global increase in morbidity and mortality. New ways of screening the general population for COVID-19 are urgently needed along with novel effective prevention and treatment strategies.
Hydroxychloroquine effects on psoriasis: A systematic review and a cautionary note for COVID-19 treatment;While evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) may decrease the viral load in patients with a COVID-19 infection, a number of case reports indicate adverse dermatologic effects of this potential treatment.
First, second and potential third generation spreads of the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China: an early exploratory study incorporating location-based service data of mobile devices;The outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has currently become a global concern. The generations of the epidemic spread are not well known, yet these are critical parameters to facilitate an understanding of the epidemic. A seafood wholesale market and Wuhan city, China, were recognized as the primary and secondary epidemic sources. Human movements nationwide from the two epidemic sources revealed the characteristics of the first-generation and second-generation spreads of the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the potential third-generation spread.
Selenium supplementation in the prevention of coronavirus infections (COVID-19);Selenium (Se) is a ubiquitous element akin to sulfur (S) existing in the Earth crust in various organic and inorganic forms. Selenium concentration varies greatly depending on the geographic area. Consequently, the content of selenium in food products is also variable. It is known that low Se is associated with increased incidence of cancer and heart diseases. Therefore, it is advisable to supplement diet with this element albeit in a proper form. Although blood increased concentrations of Se can be achieved with various pharmacological preparations, only one chemical form (sodium selenite) can offer a true protection. Sodium selenite, but not selenate, can oxidize thiol groups in the virus protein disulfide isomerase rendering it unable to penetrate the healthy cell membrane. In this way selenite inhibits the entrance of viruses into the healthy cells and abolish their infectivity. Therefore, this simple chemical compound can potentially be used in the recent battle against coronavirus epidemic.
;Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, there have been nearly 6,663,304 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 392,802 deaths, worldwide as of 10:00 CEST 06 June 2020. In Africa, 152,442 COVID-19 cases and 4334 deaths have been reported as of 02 June 2020. The five countries with the highest commutative number of cases in Africa are South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Algeria, and Ghana. Africa, and the rest of world, has had to swiftly undertake the necessary measures to protect the continent from irreversible effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that is claiming lives and destroying livelihoods. The lower number of COVID-19 cases in most African countries is attributed to inadequate health systems, low-to-absent testing capacity, poor reporting systems, and insufficient numbers of medical staff. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a great threat to most African countries, from cities to rural areas, and has created a strong demand on already scarce resources. Intense mobilization of additional resources is required to implement established emergency contingency measures. Measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include closure of borders and restricting movement of people within a country
Iron: Innocent bystander or vicious culprit in COVID-19 pathogenesis?;The coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is viciously spreading through the continents with rapidly increasing mortality rates. Current management of COVID-19 is based on the premise that respiratory failure is the leading cause of mortality. However, mounting evidence links accelerated pathogenesis in gravely ill COVID-19 patients to a hyper-inflammatory state involving a cytokine storm. Several components of the heightened inflammatory state were addressed as therapeutic targets. Another key component of the heightened inflammatory state is hyper-ferritinemia which reportedly identifies patients with increased mortality risk. In spite of its strong association with mortality, it is not yet clear if hyper-ferritinemia in COVID-19 patients is merely a systemic marker of disease progression, or a key modulator in disease pathogenesis. Here we address implications of a possible role for hyper-ferritinemia, and altered iron homeostasis in COVID-19 pathogenesis, and potential therapeutic targets in this regard.
Spatiotemporal impacts of COVID-19 on air pollution in California, USA;Various recent studies have shown that societal efforts to mitigate (e.g. “lockdown”) the outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused non-negligible impacts on the environment, especially air quality. To examine if interventional policies due to COVID-19 have had a similar impact in the US state of California, this paper investigates the spatiotemporal patterns and changes in air pollution before, during and after the lockdown of the state, comparing the air quality measurements in 2020 with historical averages from 2015 to 2019. Through time series analysis, a sudden drop and uptick of air pollution are found around the dates when shutdown and reopening were ordered, respectively. The spatial patterns of nitrogen dioxide (NO
COVID-19 pandemic and environmental pollution: A blessing in disguise?;In late 2019, a novel infectious disease with human to human transmission (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan China, which now has turned into a global pandemic. Countries all over the world have implemented some sort of lockdown to slow down its infection and mitigate it. Lockdown due to COVID-19 has drastic effects on social and economic fronts. However, this lockdown also has some positive effect on natural environment. Recent data released by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and ESA (European Space Agency) indicates that pollution in some of the epicenters of COVID-19 such as Wuhan, Italy, Spain and USA etc. has reduced up to 30%. This study compiled the environmental data released by NASA and ESA before and after the coronavirus pandemic and discusses its impact on environmental quality.
Early Identification of COVID-19 Cytokine Storm and Treatment with Anakinra or Tocilizumab;To examine outcomes among patients who were treated with the targeted anti-cytokine agents, anakinra or tocilizumab, for COVID-19 -related cytokine storm (COVID19-CS).
Tracking the origin of early COVID-19 cases in Canada;The original coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China has become a global pandemic. By tracking the earliest 118 COVID-19 cases in Canada, we produced a Voronoi treemap to show the travel origins of the country’s earliest COVID-19 cases. By March 11, 2020, even though the majority (64.1%) of the world’s COVID-19 confirmed cases still had their origin in China, only 7.6% of Canada’s first 118 COVID-19 cases were related to travelers from China. The most commonly reported travel history among the 118 cases related to the Middle East, the United States, and Europe. Thus, in retrospect, broadening of early screening tools and travel restrictions to countries and regions outside China may have helped control global COVID-19 spread.
COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents;As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 continues to spread worldwide, there have been increasing reports from Europe, North America, Asia, and Latin America describing children and adolescents with COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory conditions. However, the association between multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and COVID-19 is still unknown. We review the epidemiology, causes, clinical features, and current treatment protocols for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents associated with COVID-19. We also discuss the possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for COVID-19-induced inflammatory processes, which can lead to organ damage in paediatric patients who are severely ill. These insights provide evidence for the need to develop a clear case definition and treatment protocol for this new condition and also shed light on future therapeutic interventions and the potential for vaccine development.
Spatial and temporal differentiation of COVID-19 epidemic spread in mainland China and its influencing factors;This paper uses the exploratory spatial data analysis and the geodetector method to analyze the spatial and temporal differentiation characteristics and the influencing factors of the COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019) epidemic spread in mainland China based on the cumulative confirmed cases, average temperature, and socio-economic data. The results show that: (1) the epidemic spread rapidly from January 24 to February 20, 2020, and the distribution of the epidemic areas tended to be stable over time. The epidemic spread rate in Hubei province, in its surrounding, and in some economically developed cities was higher, while that in western part of China and in remote areas of central and eastern China was lower. (2) The global and local spatial correlation characteristics of the epidemic distribution present a positive correlation. Specifically, the global spatial correlation characteristics experienced a change process from agglomeration to decentralization. The local spatial correlation characteristics were mainly composed of the‘high-high’ and ‘low-low’ clustering types, and the situation of the contiguous layout was very significant. (3) The population inflow from Wuhan and the strength of economic connection were the main factors affecting the epidemic spread, together with the population distribution, transport accessibility, average temperature, and medical facilities, which affected the epidemic spread to varying degrees. (4) The detection factors interacted mainly through the mutual enhancement and nonlinear enhancement, and their influence on the epidemic spread rate exceeded that of single factors. Besides, each detection factor has an interval range that is conducive to the epidemic spread.
Hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients: An hypothesis;The current SARS-Cov-2 virus pandemic challenges critical care physicians and other caregivers to find effective treatment for desperately ill patients — especially those with sudden and extreme hypoxemia. Unlike patients with other forms of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, these patients do not exhibit increased lung stiffness or dramatic dyspnea., even in the presence of arterial blood oxygen levels lower than that seen normally in mixed venous blood. Urgent intubation and mechanical ventilation with high inflation pressures and raised inhaled oxygen concentration have proved unhelpful or worse, but why? Our Hypothesis is that sudden opening of a previously undetected probe-patent foramen ovale (PPFO) may explain this mystery. As hypoxemia without acidosis is a rather weak stimulus of dyspnea or increased ventilation, and opening of such an intracardiac shunt would not worsen lung mechanical properties, the absence of dramatic symptom changes would not be surprising. We point out the high frequency of PFO both in life and at autopsy, and the physiological evidence of large shunt fractions found in Covid-19 patients. Published evidence of hypercoagulability and abundant evidence of pulmonary emboli found at autopsy are in accord with our hypothesis, as they would contribute to raised pressure in the pulmonary arteries and right heart chambers, potentially causing a shunt to open. We review the interaction between viral corona spike protein and ACE-2 receptors present on the surface of alveolar lining cells, and contribution to hypercoagulabilty caused by the spike protein. Search for an open PFO after a large drop in arterial oxygen saturation can be performed at the bedside with a variety of well-established techniques including bedside echocardiography, nitrogen washout test, and imaging studies. Potential treatments might include balloon or patch closure of the shunt, and various drug treatments to lower pulmonary vascular resistance.
Air quality variations in Northern South America during the COVID-19 lockdown;Lockdown measures led to air pollution decrease in several countries around the world such as China and India, whereas other regions experimented an increase in pollutant concentrations. Northern South America (NSA) was one of those areas where pollution changed during lockdown due to high fire activity. This study aims to analyze, for the first time in NSA, the behavior of selected criteria air pollutants during the implementation of the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown in two high populated cities of the region: Bogotá and Medellín in Colombia. A set of tools including surface measurements, as well as satellite and modeled data were used. 24-hour average concentrations of PM
Spatiotemporal dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the State of Kuwait;Prompt understanding of the temporal and spatial patterns of the COVID-19 pandemic on a national level is a critical step for the timely allocation of surveillance resources. Therefore, this study explored the temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait using daily confirmed case data collected between the 23 February and 07 May 2020.
Crossing barriers: Role of a tele-outreach program addressing psychosocial needs in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic;Novel Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID 19) pandemic has affected more than 2 million individuals and causing over 0.1 million deaths worldwide. In India, the pandemic has gained momentum in the last few weeks with over 10,000 cases and 400 deaths. In the absence of any pharmacological cure on the horizon, countries have resorted to the use of strict public health measures to curtail spread of further infection to fight the coronavirus. The pandemic and its social implications have triggered mental health concerns among the masses. Providing psychological first aid and psychosocial support is vital in mitigating the distress and enhance the coping strategies of people to deal with this biological disaster. Tele-mental health services play an important role in this regard. In this article we describe our preliminary experience in understanding the psychological concerns of general public and addressing them by providing psychological support through a national telephonic helpline.
A chemical cocktail during the COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing, China: Insights from six-year aerosol particle composition measurements during the Chinese New Year holiday;The rapidly spread coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has limited people's outdoor activities and hence caused substantial reductions in anthropogenic emissions around the world. However, the air quality in some megacities has not been improved as expected due to the complex responses of aerosol chemistry to the changes in precursors and meteorology. Here we demonstrate the responses of primary and secondary aerosol species to the changes in anthropogenic emissions during the COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing, China along with the Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday effects on air pollution by using six-year aerosol particle composition measurements. Our results showed large reductions in primary aerosol species associated with traffic, cooking and coal combustion emissions by 30–50% on average during the CNY, while the decreases in secondary aerosol species were much small (5–12%). These results point towards a future challenge in mitigating secondary air pollution because the reduced gaseous precursors may not suppress secondary aerosol formation efficiently under stagnant meteorological conditions. By analyzing the long-term measurements from 2012 to 2020, we found considerable increases in the ratios of nitrate to sulfate, secondary to primary OA, and sulfur and nitrogen oxidation capacity despite the overall decreasing trends in mass concentrations of most aerosol species, suggesting that the decreases in anthropogenic emissions have facilitated secondary formation processes during the last decade. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms driving the chemical responses of secondary aerosol to the changes in anthropogenic emissions under complex meteorological environment is essential for future mitigation of air pollution in China.
Risk of the Brazilian health care system over 5572 municipalities to exceed health care capacity due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19);The spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has challenged governments to develop public policies to reduce the load of the COVID-19 on health care systems, which is commonly referred to as “flattening the curve”. This study aims to address this issue by proposing a spatial multicriteria approach to estimate the risk of the Brazilian health care system, by municipality, to exceed the health care capacity because of an influx of patients infected with the COVID-19. We estimated this risk for 5572 municipalities in Brazil using a combination of a multicriteria decision-making approach with spatial analysis to estimate the exceedance risk, and then, we examined the risk variation by designing 5 control intervention scenarios (3 scenarios representing reduction on social contacts, and 2 scenarios representing investment on health care system). For the baseline scenario using an average infection rate across Brazil, we estimated a mean Hospital Bed Capacity (HBC) value of −16.73, indicating that, on average, the Brazilian municipalities will have a deficit of approximately 17 beds. This deficit is projected to occur in 3338 municipalities with the north and northeast regions being at the greatest risk of exceeding health care capacity due to the COVID-19. The intervention scenarios indicate across all of Brazil that they could address the bed shortage, with an average of available beds between 23 and 32. However, when we consider the shortages at a municipal scale, bed exceedances still occur for at least 2119 municipalities in the most effective intervention scenario. Our findings are essential to identify priority areas, to compare populations, and to provide options for government agencies to act. This study can be used to provide support for the creation of effective health public policies for national, regional, and local intervention.
;Concerns have been raised about the possibility that inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) could predispose individuals to severe COVID-19
Long-distance truck drivers and the increasing risk of COVID-19 spread in Uganda;To examine the patterns of COVID-19 transmission in Uganda.
Clinical recurrences of COVID-19 symptoms after recovery: viral relapse, reinfection or inflammatory rebound?;For the first 3 months of COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 was expected to be an immunizing non-relapsing disease. We report a national case series of 11 virologically-confirmed COVID-19 patients having experienced a second clinically- and virologically-confirmed acute COVID-19 episode. According to the clinical history, we discuss either re-infection or reactivation hypothesis. Larger studies including further virological, immunological and epidemiologic data are needed to understand the mechanisms of these recurrences.
Methylene blue may have a role in the treatment of COVID-19;In this paper, we raise the hypothesis that Methylene Blue may be a treatment option for Corona Virus Disease of 2019 specially when combined with Non Steroid Anti-Inflammatory Drugs. In previous publications including ours, the role of kininogen system has been postulated. A correlation between clinical findings of the disease and this mechanism has been drawn to denote a pivotal role of kininogen-kallikrein system in pathophysiology of the disease. Therein the possible role of Icatibant, Ecallantide and Aprotinin in the treatment of this disease has been raised. Here we want to emphasize on an important post-receptor mechanism of bradykinin that is Nitric Oxide. We came to this aim because we found out how access to these novel treatment nominees may be expensive and unaffordable. For this reason we are focusing on possible role of an old albeit “mysterious” drug namely Methylene Blue. This medication may abort effects of Bradykinin by inhibition of Nitric Oxide synthase inhibitor and promote oxygen saturation while it is inexpensive and ubiquitously accessible. Clinical studies cannot be over emphasized.
Effect of lockdown due to SARS COVID-19 on aerosol optical depth (AOD) over urban and mining regions in India;The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-COronaVIrus Diseases 2019 (SARS-COVID-19) pandemic has posed a serious threat to human health (death) and substantial economic losses across the globe. It was however presumed that extreme preventive measures of entire lockdown in India might have reduced the air pollution level and therefore decreased the aerosol optical depth (AOD). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) daily AOD product was deployed to investigate the change in AOD level during lockdown phases across the Indian Territory as compared to the long-term mean AOD level (2000–2019) of the same periods. The key findings of the study revealed that AOD level over the Indian Territory is greatly reduced (~45%) during the lockdown periods as compared to the long-term mean AOD level (2000–2019). Furthermore, a noteworthy negative AOD anomaly (~6 to 37%) was observed across the four metropolitan cities in India during the entire lockdown period (25th March to 15th May 2020). However, coal mining regions of the various coalfields in India showed a positive anomaly (~+11 to 40%) during the lockdown periods due to ongoing mining operations. In a nutshell, the study results indicated a huge drop in the AOD level over Indian Territory during lockdown periods. It is expected that the pandemic can influence some policy decisions to propose air pollution control methods. Lockdown events possibly may play a crucial role as a potential solution for air pollution abatement in the future. It may not be uncommon in future when the governments may implement deliberately selective lockdowns at pollution hotspots to control the pollution level.
COVID-19–We urgently need to start developing an exit strategy;The purpose of this perspective is to review the options countries have to exit the draconian “lockdowns” in a carefully staged manner.
Preventing carbon emission retaliatory rebound post-COVID-19 requires expanding free trade and improving energy efficiency;Existing studies have shown that the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp drop in carbon emissions in 2020. A recent example of the impact of sudden extreme events on carbon emissions occurred in the 2008 global financial crisis, in which carbon emissions droped in 2009, but jumped in 2010. This study is aimed to discuss how to prevent the retaliatory growth of carbon emissions post COVID-19 through learning the lessons from analysis of short-term and long-term drivers of carbon emissions. This study explored the short-term (annual) effects (population scale. affluence level, carbon intensity, energy intensity) of changes in carbon emissions by decomposing carbon emissions in the world, different income groups and selected countries before and after the 2008 financial crisis using LMDI technique. In addition, this study explored the long-term effects (energy consumption per capita, energy structure, energy intensity, foreign direct investment, and trade openness) of changes in carbon emissions by decomposing carbon emission in the world and different income groups from 1990 to 2014 using VAR technique. The decomposition results of short-term drivers of carbon emission uncovered that the deterioration in energy efficiency (increase in energy intensity) was the main reason for the retaliatory rebound in carbon emissions post-2008 financial crisis, especially in high-income countries. The decomposition results of long-term drivers of carbon emission uncovered that trade openness contributed to reduce carbon emission in the world and the incomes groups in the long term, although trade openness led to increase in carbon emission in developing countries in the short term. To prevent retaliatory rebound of carbon emissions, what we should learn two lessons from the decomposition of carbon emission: improving energy efficiency, and expanding trade openness. Unfortunately, energy efficiency has been neglected in the economic recovery plans to respond to COVID-19 of various countries, especially developed countries, and worse, trade protectionism is on the rise, especially in developed countries. Therefore, we are pessimistic about preventing a retaliatory rebound in carbon emissions post-COVID-19 for now.
Changes in testing rates could mask the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) growth rate;Since the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 in China, it has rapidly spread around the world, leading to one of the most significant pandemic events of recent history. Deriving reliable estimates of the COVID-19 epidemic growth rate is quite important to guide the timing and intensity of intervention strategies. Indeed, many studies have quantified the epidemic growth rate using time-series of reported cases during the early phase of the outbreak to estimate the basic reproduction number, 
Repositioning of pentoxifylline as an immunomodulator and regulator of the renin-angiotensin system in the treatment of COVID-19;Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, which in turn activate protein kinase, leading to a reduction in the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines to ultimately influence the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) 
A hypothesis about the role of fetal hemoglobin in COVID-19;COVID-19 infection is less common in children (with higher fetal hemoglobin levels). In our preliminary study, we also observed a low prevalence and fatality of COVID-19 in countries with high rate of hemoglobinopathy carries. Given these two facts, the hemoglobin structure can play a role in the physiopathology of COVID-19 disease. Several drugs are known to increase fetal hemoglobin in adults. Adding these drugs to COVID-19 clinical trials may improve the patients’ outcomes.
The relative transmissibility of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections among close contacts;Asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 is an important topic. A recent study in China showed that transmissibility of the asymptomatic cases is comparable to that of symptomatic cases. Here, we discuss that the conclusion may depend on how we interpret the data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the relative transmissibility of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections is quantified.
Can we contain the COVID-19 outbreak with the same measures as for SARS?;The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 resulted in more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths. SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine. By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated. By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths. Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19. COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread. Even if traditional public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths. Exportations to other countries need not result in rapid large-scale outbreaks, if countries have the political will to rapidly implement countermeasures.
Food waste management during the COVID-19 outbreak: a holistic climate, economic and nutritional approach;Improving the food supply chain efficiency has been identified as an essential means to enhance food security, while reducing pressure on natural resources. Adequate food loss and waste (FLW) management has been proposed as an approach to meet these objectives. The main hypothesis of this study is to consider that the “strong fluctuations and short-term changes” on eating habits may have major consequences on potential FLW generation and management, as well as on GHG emissions, all taking into account the nutritional and the economic cost. Due to the exceptional lockdown measures imposed by the Spanish government, as a consequence of the emerging coronavirus disease, COVID-19, food production and consumption systems have undergone significant changes, which must be properly studied in order to propose strategies from the lessons learned. Taking Spain as a case study, the methodological approach included a deep analysis of the inputs and outputs of the Spanish food basket, the supply chain by means of a Material Flow Analysis, as well as an economic and comprehensive nutritional assessment, all under a life cycle thinking approach. The results reveal that during the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown, there was no significant adjustment in overall FLW generation, but a partial reallocation from extra-domestic consumption to households occurred (12% increase in household FLW). Moreover, the economic impact (+11%), GHG emissions (+10%), and the nutritional content (−8%) complete the multivariable impact profile that the COVID-19 outbreak had on FLW generation and management. Accordingly, this study once again highlights that measures aimed at reducing FLW, particularly in the household sector, are critical to make better use of food surpluses and FLW prevention and control, allowing us to confront future unforeseen scenarios.
Voluntary collective isolation as a best response to COVID-19 for indigenous populations? A case study and protocol from the Bolivian Amazon;Indigenous communities worldwide share common features that make them especially vulnerable to the complications of and mortality from COVID-19. They also possess resilient attributes that can be leveraged to promote prevention efforts. How can indigenous communities best mitigate potential devastating effects of COVID-19? In Bolivia, where nearly half of all citizens claim indigenous origins, no specific guidelines have been outlined for indigenous communities inhabiting native communal territories. In this Public Health article, we describe collaborative efforts, as anthropologists, physicians, tribal leaders, and local officials, to develop and implement a multiphase COVID-19 prevention and containment plan focused on voluntary collective isolation and contact-tracing among Tsimane forager-horticulturalists in the Bolivian Amazon. Phase 1 involves education, outreach, and preparation, and phase 2 focuses on containment, patient management, and quarantine. Features of this plan might be exported and adapted to local circumstances elsewhere to prevent widespread mortality in indigenous communities.
Statistical and network analysis of 1212 COVID-19 patients in Henan, China;COVID-19 is spreading quickly all over the world. Publicly released data for 1212 COVID-19 patients in Henan of China were analyzed in this paper.
Pirfenidone: A novel hypothetical treatment for COVID-19;Cytokine storm, multiorgan failure, and particularly acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with COVID-19. A fulminant ARDS kills the majority of COVID-19 victims.
Potential role of statins in COVID-19;Patients with COVID-19 infection have an increased risk of cardiovascular complications and thrombotic events. Statins are known for their pleiotropic anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and immunomodulatory effects. They may have a potential role as adjunctive therapy to mitigate endothelial dysfunction and dysregulated inflammation in patients with COVID-19 infection.
;Two thirds of countries globally are unprepared to respond to a health emergency as per the International Health Regulations (2005), with conflict-affected countries like Syria being particularly vulnerable. Political influences on outbreak preparedness, response and reporting may also adversely affect control of SARS-CoV-2 in Syria. Syria reported its first case on 22 March 2020
The effects of COVID-19 induced lockdown measures on maritime settings of a coastal region;The spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) caused an unprecedented implementation of lockdown measures across world's nations. Veneto Region, located in North-Eastern Adriatic Sea was one of the first maritime regions in Italy and Europe subjected to progressive lockdown restrictions. We systematically analyse the effects of national lockdown policies on maritime settings of the region using Automated Identification System (AIS) data from fishing vessels, passenger ships, tanker and cargo vessels collected through the Aqua Alta Oceanographic Tower (AAOT). We derive consequences on vessel activities during the March–April 2020 lockdown, by using a data-driven, comparative spatio-temporal analysis of vessel trajectories. Results show that compared to the same period of 2017, vessel activity were reduced by 69% during the lockdown, fishing activities reduced by 84% and passenger traffic by 78%. We register a restart of fishing activity in the third week of April 2020. We suggest that the presented conceptual and spatial assessment protocol can guide future research on environmental and socio-economic effects of COVID-19 on marine realms and contribute to further interdisciplinary research with other marine scientific fields.
Mass masking as a way to contain COVID-19 and exit lockdown in low- and middle-income countries;In new guidelines published on June 5th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that in areas with ongoing COVID-19 community transmission, governments should encourage the general public to wear face masks in specific situations and settings as part of a comprehensive approach to suppress COVID-19 transmission. Recent online surveys in 206,729 persons residing in nine low- and middle-income countries showed that 32.7%-99.7% of respondents used face masks with significant differences across age groups and sexes. Targeted health promotion strategies and government support are required to increase mask use by the general population.
COVID-19 and picotechnology: Potential opportunities;Humanity's challenges are becoming increasingly difficult, and as these challenges become more advanced, the need for effective and intelligent action becomes more apparent. Meanwhile, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has plagued the world, could be considered as an opportunity to take a step toward the need for atomic engineering, compared to molecular engineering, as well as to accelerate this type of research. This approach, which can be expressed in terms of picotechnology, makes it possible to identify living cell types or in general, chemical and biological surfaces using their atomic arrays, and applied for early diagnosis even treatment of the disease.
On the crucial role of multilingual biomedical databases in epidemic events (SARS-CoV-2 analysis);The need for multilingual biomedical databases was already pointed out by different authors. They argue about the need for making translations available in other languages and centralized access to regional databases and that one should not disregard citations in other languages. This fact could not be any more real in the current situation regarding the novel coronavirus. When considering treatment, diagnosis and prevention, around 44% of the articles in PubMed were written in Chinese. This prompts the urgent need for quality automatic translation to make such extremely valuable information available to medical personnel in as many languages as possible. We also point out that the community should also make efforts to guarantee editorial quality and to follow the best practices in editing and publishing. This is of critical importance as well, such that the content is properly scrutinized before being published.

Adoption of personal protective measures by ordinary citizens during the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan;To clarify the implementation status of personal protective measures by ordinary citizens in Japan during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.
Hand Hygiene During COVID-19: Recommendations from the American Contact Dermatitis Society;The recent coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in increased hand hygiene and hand cleansing awareness. To prevent virus transmission, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends frequent hand washing with soap and water. Hand hygiene products are available in a variety of forms and while each of these formulations may be effective against COVID-19, they may also alter skin barrier integrity and function. As health care workers and the general population focus on stringent hand hygiene, the American Contact Dermatitis Society (ACDS) anticipates an increase in both irritant contact and allergic contact hand dermatitis. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers with moisturizers have the least sensitizing and irritancy potential when compared to soaps and synthetic detergents. This article provides an overview of the most frequently used hand hygiene products and their associations with contact dermatitis as well as recommendations from the ACDS on how to treat and prevent further dermatitis.
;COVID-19 poses an extraordinary threat to global public health and an effective vaccine could provide a key means of overcoming this crisis. Human challenge studies involve the intentional infection of research participants and can accelerate or improve vaccine development by rapidly providing estimates of vaccine safety and efficacy. Human challenge studies of low virulence coronaviruses have been done in the past and human challenge studies with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have been proposed. These studies of coronaviruses could provide considerable benefits to public health
Effect of restricted emissions during COVID-19 on air quality in India;The effectiveness and cost are always top factors for policy-makers to decide control measures and most measures had no pre-test before implementation. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, human activities are largely restricted in many regions in India since mid-March of 2020, and it is a progressing experiment to testify effectiveness of restricted emissions. In this study, concentrations of six criteria pollutants, PM
Impact of lockdown measures to combat Covid-19 on air quality over western Europe;Recent studies based on observations have shown the impact of lockdown measures taken in various European countries to contain the Covid-19 pandemic on air quality. However, these studies are often limited to compare situations without and with lockdown measures, which correspond to different time periods and then under different meteorological conditions. We propose a modelling study with the WRF-CHIMERE modelling suite for March 2020, an approach allowing to compare atmospheric composition with and without lockdown measures without the biases of meteorological conditions. This study shows that the lockdown effect on atmospheric composition, in particular through massive traffic reductions, has been important for several short-lived atmospheric trace species, with a large reduction in NO

Spatial modeling, risk mapping, change detection, and outbreak trend analysis of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Iran (days between February 19 and June 14, 2020);Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a major pandemic threat that has spread to more than 212 countries with more than 432,902 recorded deaths and 7,898,442 confirmed cases worldwide so far (on June 14, 2020). It is crucial to investigate the spatial drivers to prevent and control the epidemic of COVID-19.
Significant decrease of lightning activities during COVID-19 lockdown period over Kolkata megacity in India;The outbreak of COVID-19 has now created the largest pandemic and the World health organization (WHO) has declared social distancing as the key precaution to confront such type of infections. Most of the countries have taken protective measures by the nationwide lockdown. The purpose of this study is to understand the effect of lockdown on air pollutants and to analyze pre-monsoon (April and May) cloud-to-ground and inter-cloud lightning activity in relation to air pollutants i.e. suspended Particulate matter (PM
Natural RNA dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors: Molecular docking studies of some biologically active alkaloids of ;COVID-19 has become disastrous for world and spread all over. Researchers all around the globe are working to discover a drug to cure from COVID-19. RNA dependent RNA polymerase plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 replication and thus it could be a potential target for SARS-CoV-2. This study revealed that Protopine, Allocryptopine and (±) 6- Acetonyldihydrochelerythrine could be potential RdRp inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.
Preliminary estimates of the reproduction number of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Republic of Korea and Italy by 5 March 2020;The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has caused 6088 cases and 41 deaths in Republic of Korea, and 3144 cases and 107 death in Italy by 5 March 2020, respectively. We modelled the transmission process in the Republic of Korea and Italy with a stochastic model, and estimated the basic reproduction number 
Spatiotemporal variations and reduction of air pollutants during the COVID-19 pandemic in a megacity of Yangtze River Delta in China;In recent decades, air pollution has become an important environmental problem in the megacities of eastern China. How to control air pollution in megacities is still a challenging issue because of the complex pollutant sources, atmospheric chemistry, and meteorology. There is substantial uncertainty in accurately identifying the contributions of transport and local emissions to the air quality in megacities. The COVID-19 outbreak has prompted a nationwide public lockdown period and provides a valuable opportunity for understanding the sources and factors of air pollutants. The three-month period of continuous field observations for aerosol particles and gaseous pollutants, which extended from January 2020 to March 2020, covered urban, urban-industry, and suburban areas in the typical megacity of Hangzhou in the Yangtze River Delta in eastern China. In general, the concentrations of PM
COVID-19 pandemic and admission rates for and management of acute coronary syndromes in England;Several countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic have reported a substantial drop in the number of patients attending the emergency department with acute coronary syndromes and a reduced number of cardiac procedures. We aimed to understand the scale, nature, and duration of changes to admissions for different types of acute coronary syndrome in England and to evaluate whether in-hospital management of patients has been affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
;With the domestic and international spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), much attention has been given to estimating pandemic risk. We propose the novel application of a well-established scientific approach – the network analysis – to provide a direct visualization of the COVID-19 pandemic risk
Activated macrophages are the main inflammatory cell in COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia infiltrates. Is it possible to show their metabolic activity and thus the grade of inflammatory burden with ;The recent outbreak of Covid-19 has represented a major challenge for the countries affected by the disease, not only in terms of loss of human life, economic downturn, and constraint on individual freedom, but also for the great pressure on the national health systems and hospitals. The 380 kDa virus has been a perfect storm, especially for those national health systems used to working with limited resources and high intensity rhythms, such as Italy. For the first time in the new century, a virtually unknown fast-spreading disease has caused a public health emergency thus forcing most countries to deal with an insurmountable logistic gap. Hence, every branch of Medicine, even though not directly involved in the treatment, has been called upon to provide its contribution to resolve the crisis. It is now becoming more apparent that Covid-19 is not solely a lung disease, but a complex systemic disease involving several organs and systems. This is due to an abnormal inflammatory response which eventually leads to multisystemic coagulopathy which mainly, but not uniquely, targets the lungs. Although the pathophysiology of this syndrome is still not fully understood, macrophages and their immune complex system seem to play a key role. It is not yet clear why some patients develop the violent immune response which results in pneumonitis while others do not. There are clues indicating that the systemic hyper-inflammation defined as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), or cytokine storm, requires an increase in choline consumption to synthesize phosphatidylcholine and stimulate phagocytosis, organelle biogenesis, secretory functions, and endocytosis. 
COVID-19 and autism;The current pandemic of Covid-19 has created a paradigm for possibly gaining greater insight in two conditions:
Serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections;To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs.
The sensitivity and specificity analyses of ambient temperature and population size on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in different provinces of Iran;On 10 April 2020, Iran reported 68,192 COVID-19 cumulative cases including 4232 death and 35,465 recovery cases. Numerous factors could influence the transmission rate and survival of coronavirus. On this basis and according to the latest epidemiological researches, both ambient temperature (AT) and population size (PS) can be considered as significant transmissibility factors for coronavirus. The analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) allows measuring the performance of a classification model using the confusion matrix. This study intends to investigate the sensitivity of AT and PS on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus in different provinces of Iran. For this purpose, the information of each province of Iran including the annual average of AT and the number of healthy and diseased cases are categorized. Subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity analyses of both AT and PS factors are performed. The obtained results confirm that AT and PS have low sensibility and high sensitivity, respectively. Thus, there is no scientific reason to confirm that the number of COVID-19 cases in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates. Therefore, it is recommended that the cities/provinces with a population of over 1.7 million people have stricter inspections and more precise controls as their management policy.
Mesenchymal stem cells-bridge catalyst between innate and adaptive immunity in COVID 19;Majority of patients infected with the COVID 19 virus display a mild to moderate course of disease and spontaneously recover at 14–20 days. However, about 15% of patients progress to severe stages and 2.5% of these patients succumb to this illness. Most patients with severe disease belong to the elderly age group (<65 years of age) and have multiple associated co-morbidities. The immune responses induced by the COVID 19 virus, during the incubation and non-severe stages, requires the early initiation of a specific adaptive immune response to eliminate the virus and prevent the progress to severe stages. In patients with a dysfunctional bridge adaptive immunity, the innate immune response becomes exaggerated due to the lack of feedback from the adaptive immune cells. The resultant cytokine storm is responsible for the severe lung injury leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome seen in COVID 19 patients.
Ascertainment rate of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Japan;To estimate the ascertainment rate of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Assessing the anxiety level of Iranian general population during COVID-19 outbreak;This study is aimed to assess the anxiety level of Iranian general population during COVID-19 outbreak. The online questionnaire surveyed 10,754 individuals from the general population of 31 provinces of Iran who completed the questionnaire on social networks from March 1 to March 9, 2020. The inferential statistics suggests that the level of anxiety was higher among women (95 % CI [0.1, 81.36], p < 0.001), people who more followed corona-related news (p < 0.001) and the age group of 21–40 years (p < 0.001). Ultimately, the level of anxiety was significantly higher among people who had at least one family member, relative, or friend who contracted COVID-19 disease (95 % CI [1.2, 35.03], p < 0.001). The health care system should adopt a package of psychosocial interventions to reduce the anxiety of high risk groups.
;Pulmonary hypertension is a significant complication for some patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially those requiring intensive care. Tachyphylaxis to the current therapy, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), is also common. In vitro, folic acid directly increases nitric oxide (NO) production and extends its duration of action
Air quality changes in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic;In December 2019, a new, severe coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan, China. Shortly after, the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the United States. The emergence of this virus led many United States governors to enact executive orders in an effort to limit the person-to-person spread of the virus. One state that utilized such measures was New York, which contains New York City (NYC), the most populous city in the United States. Many reports have shown that due to the government-backed shutdowns, the air quality in major global cities improved. However, there has been only limited work on whether this same trend is seen throughout the United States, specifically within the densely populated NYC area. Thus, the focus of this study was to examine whether changes in air quality were observed in NYC resulting from New York State's COVID-19-associated shutdown measures. To do this, daily concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM
;Respiratory viruses are a major cause of mortality worldwide and in France, where they cause several thousands of deaths every year. University Hospital Institute-Méditerranée Infection performs real-time surveillance of all diagnoses of infections and associated deaths in public hospitals in Marseille, Southeastern France. This study compared mortality associated with diagnoses of respiratory viruses during the colder months of 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 (week 47–week 14). In 2018–2019, 73 patients (0.17% of 42,851 hospitalized patients) died after being diagnosed with a respiratory virus
Inhaled hydroxychloroquine to improve efficacy and reduce harm in the treatment of COVID-19;Current formulations and dose regimens of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) put patients at risk of harm. An analysis of clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov revealed that this may continue as many studies combine HCQ with agents that prolong the QT interval. Further, almost all of the trials registered do not consider dosage adjustment in the elderly, a patient population most likely to require HCQ treatment. Here we describe an inhaled formulation of HCQ which has passed safety studies in clinical trials for the treatment of asthma and discuss how this approach may reduce side-effects and improve efficacy. As this simple formulation progressed to phase II studies, safety data can be used to immediately enable phase II trials in COVID-19.
Coronavirus disease 2019 in elderly patients: Characteristics and prognostic factors based on 4-week follow-up;To investigate the characteristics and prognostic factors in the elderly patients with COVID-19.
A preliminary assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on environment – A case study of China;The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is seriously threatening world public health security. Currently, >200 countries and regions have been affected by the epidemic, with the number of infections and deaths still increasing. As an extreme event, the outbreak of COVID-19 has greatly damaged the global economic growth and caused a certain impact on the environment. This paper takes China as a case study, comprehensively evaluating the dynamic impact of COVID-19 on the environment. The analysis results indicate that the outbreak of COVID-19 improves China's air quality in the short term and significantly contributes to global carbon emission reduction. However, in the long run, there is no evidence that this improvement will continue. When China completely lifts the lockdown and resumes large-scale industrial production, its energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are likely to exceed the level before the event. Moreover, COVID-19 significantly reduces the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO
Clinical and transmission dynamics characteristics of 406 children with coronavirus disease 2019 in China: A review;Chinese pediatricians are working on the front line to fight COVID-19. They have published a great amount of first-hand clinical data. Collecting their data and forming a large sample for analysis is more conducive to the recognition, prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in children. The epidemic prevention and control experience of Chinese pediatricians should be shared with the world.
Diabetes and severity of COVID-19: What is the link?;In Diabetes Mellitus the loss of capacity to regulate immunity, the reduction of pulmonary functions and the pro-thrombotic state determine the severity of COVID-19.
The intriguing commonality of NETosis between COVID-19 & Periodontal disease;NETosis, being an alternative form of cell death is the creation of web-like chromatin decondensates by suitably primed neutrophils as a response to stimulus aimed at containing and eliminating the same. In certain situations, it causes more harm than benefit in the form of bystander damage directly or via activation of autoimmune mechanisms. Such pathophysiology finds evidence in both Periodontal disease and COVID-19. Coupled with impaired removal, NETs have been implicated in both these disease forms to promote a state of inflammation and be a source of constant harm to the tissues involved. This potentially forms groundwork to implicate Periodontal disease as predisposing towards adverse COVID-19 related outcomes.
Pilgrimage and COVID-19: The risk among returnees from Muslim countries;COVID-19 has now spread to become a pandemic. We confirmed six Muslim pilgrims with COVID-19 among the passengers on a flight from Pakistan, following a border inspection in Guangzhou, China. We subsequently alerted home countries to prepare early in order to manage the risk from returning pilgrims. The resulting strategies of inspection and quarantine needed to cover those returning from all Muslim countries, not just Saudi Arabia.
Addressing the corona virus pandemic: will a novel filtered eye mask help?;Non-hermetically sealed eye protection does not fully protect the eyes from airborne particles. Hermetically sealed eye protection fully protects the eyes from particles, but tends to fog up, rendering it unusable. This study aimed to build and test a filtered eye mask (FEM) to protect the eyes from airborne particles, while being usable without excessive fog build up.
As a potential treatment of COVID-19: Montelukast;It has been hypothesized that Montelukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) receptor antagonist, with effects of anti-inflammatory, suppress oxidative stress and reduce affect cytokine production, may limited progression of the disease on COVID-19 infection.
Vitamin D: A simpler alternative to tocilizumab for trial in COVID-19?;There is anecdotal evidence that tocilizumab, an immunosuppressant drug, may be a potential therapeutic option for patients with severe manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Like tocilizumab, Vitamin D appears to modulate the activity of an interleukin (IL-6), which may explain the seasonal variation in prevalence of influenza. While most cases of COVID-19 have, thus far, occurred in the Northern Hemisphere winter, limiting the ability to assess seasonal variation, there remains substantial variation in the severity of this condition that has yet to be explained. A retrospective comparison of Vitamin D levels in previously obtained blood samples between survivors and confirmed fatalities could establish a rationale for implementation of widespread Vitamin D supplementation. This would be far cheaper and simpler than tocilizumab as a therapeutic option to trial.
Evaluation and prediction of the COVID-19 variations at different input population and quarantine strategies, a case study in Guangdong province, China;In this study, an epidemic model was developed to simulate and predict the disease variations of Guangdong province which was focused on the period from Jan 27 to Feb 20, 2020. To explore the impacts of the input population and quarantine strategies on the disease variations at different scenarios, four time points were assumed as Feb 6, Feb 16, Feb 24 and Mar 5 2020. The major results suggest that our model can well capture the disease variations with high accuracy. The simulated peak value of the confirmed cases is 1002 at Feb 10, 2020 which is mostly close to the reported number of 1007 at Feb 9, 2020. The disease will become extinction with peak value of 1397 at May 11, 2020. Moreover, the increased numbers of the input population can mainly shorten the disease extinction days and the increased percentages of the exposed individuals of the input population increase the number of cumulative confirmed cases at a small percentage. Increasing the input population and decreasing the quarantine strategy together around the time point of the peak value of the confirmed cases, may lead to the second outbreak.
COVID-19 infection can cause chemotherapy resistance development in patients with breast cancer and tamoxifen may cause susceptibility to COVID-19 infection;Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and is the second most common cause of death in women. Estrogen plays an important role in breast tumor etiopathogenesis. Tamoxifen and other anti-estrogen drugs are used in breast cancer patients who have a positive estrogen receptor (ER). While angiotensin II plays a key role in breast cancer etiology and causes tamoxifen resistance, angiotensin 1–7 has been reported to may reduce the spread and invasion of breast cancer. During the COVID-19 infection, the virus blocks ACE2, and angiotensin 1–7 production discontinued. Angiotensin III production may increase as angiotensin II destruction is reduced. Thus, aminopeptidase upregulation may occur. Increased aminopeptidase may develop resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Estrogen can have a protective effect against COVID-19. Estrogen increase causes ER-α upregulation in T lymphocytes. Thus, estrogen increases the release of interferon I and III from T lymphocytes. Increasing interferon I and III alleviates COVID-19 infection. Tamoxifen treatment causes down-regulation, mutation, or loss in estrogen receptors. In the long-term use of tamoxifen, its effects on estrogen receptors can be permanent. Thus, since estrogen receptors are damaged or downregulated, estrogen may not act by binding to these receptors. Tamoxifen is a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, independent of its effect on estrogen receptors. It suppresses T cell functions and interferon release. We think tamoxifen may increase the COVID-19 risk due to its antiestrogen and P-glycoprotein inhibitory effects.
The profile of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and serum cytokines in children with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia;The study was aimed at investigating the characteristics of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and serum cytokines in children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia.
Impact of city lockdown on the air quality of COVID-19-hit of Wuhan city;A series of strict lockdown measures were implemented in the areas of China worst affected by coronavirus disease 19, including Wuhan, to prevent the disease spreading. The lockdown had a substantial environmental impact, because traffic pollution and industrial emissions are important factors affecting air quality and public health in the region. After the lockdown, the average monthly air quality index (AQI) in Wuhan was 59.7, which is 33.9% lower than that before the lockdown (January 23, 2020) and 47.5% lower than that during the corresponding period (113.6) from 2015 to 2019. Compared with the conditions before the lockdown, fine particulate matter (PM
Combination of thrombolytic and immunosuppressive therapy for coronavirus disease 2019: A case report;In a proportion of patients, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a multisystem syndrome characterized by hyperinflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and hypercoagulability. A 68-year-old man with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was admitted to the intensive care unit with respiratory failure, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and skin ischemia – microthrombosis. Specific coagulation and inflammatory markers (D-dimer, ferritin, and C-reactive protein), along with the clinical picture, triggered the trial of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and tocilizumab. This was followed by resolution of the skin ischemia and CRS, while respiratory parameters improved. No major complications associated with rt-PA or tocilizumab occurred. The combination of rt-PA with targeted anti-inflammatory treatment could be a new therapeutic option for patients with COVID-19, ARDS, hyperinflammation, and increased blood viscosity.
Some respite for India's dirtiest river? Examining the Yamuna's water quality at Delhi during the COVID-19 lockdown period;The Yamuna's stretch within Delhi is considered as the dirtiest river reach in India and despite numerous restoration plans, pollution levels have risen unabated. However, the enforcement of a nationwide lockdown due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic can possibly provide a ray of hope. We analyze the lockdown's impact on the water quality status of this stretch using a combination of measured parameters and satellite image derived indices. Class C Water Quality Index estimates of nine stations indicate an improvement of 37% during the lockdown period. The Biological Oxygen Demand and Chemical Oxygen Demand values reduced by 42.83% and 39.25%, respectively, compared to the pre-lockdown phase, while Faecal Coliform declined by over 40%. Similar analysis of 20 major drains that meet the Yamuna revealed declining effluent loads and discernable improvements in drain contaminant status were ascertained via a hierarchical cluster analysis. Reach-wise suspended particulate matter content, turbidity and algal signatures were derived from multi-temporal Landsat-8 images of prior and ongoing lockdown periods for 117 channel segment zones. These parameters also declined notably within most stretches, although their extents were spatially varied. While the partial/non-operational status of most industries during the lockdown enabled significant reduction in effluent loads and a consequent betterment in the river water quality, its spatial variations and even deterioration in some locations resulted from the largely undiminished inflow of domestic sewage through multiple drains. This study provides an estimate of possible river recovery extents and degree of improvement if deleterious polluting activities and contaminants are regulated properly.
Hypertension prevalence in human coronavirus disease: the role of ACE system in infection spread and severity;The prevalence of hypertension is high in patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and it appears to be related to an increased risk of mortality, as shown in many epidemiological studies. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) system is not uniformly expressed in all of the human races, and current differences could explain some of the geographical discrepancies in infection around the world. Furthermore, animal studies have shown that the ACE2 receptor is a potential pathway for host infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. As two-thirds of hypertensive patients take ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, several concerns have been raised about the detrimental role of current antihypertensive drugs in COVID-19. This report summarizes the recent evidence for and against the administration of ACE blockade in the COVID-19 era.
Comparison of different samples for 2019 novel coronavirus detection by nucleic acid amplification tests;An ongoing outbreak of severe respiratory pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus has recently emerged in China. Here we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of 19 suspect cases. We compared the positive ratio of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid amplification test results from different samples including oropharyngeal swab, blood, urine and stool with 3 different fluorescent RT-PCR kits. Nine out of the 19 patients had 2019-nCoV infection detected using oropharyngeal swab samples, and the virus nucleic acid was also detected in eight of these nine patients using stool samples. None of positive results was identified in the blood and urine samples. These three different kits got the same result for each sample and the positive ratio of nucleic acid detection for 2019-nCoV was only 47.4% in the suspect patients. Therefore, it is possible that infected patients have been missed by using nucleic acid detection only. It might be better to make a diagnosis combining the computed tomography scans and nucleic acid detection.
Significant changes in the chemical compositions and sources of PM;Wuhan was the first city to adopt the lockdown measures to prevent COVID-19 spreading, which improved the air quality accordingly. This study investigated the variations in chemical compositions, source contributions, and regional transport of fine particles (PM
Increased susceptibility of SARS-CoV2 infection on oral cancer patients;In 2019, a new coronavirus (SARS CoV2) infecting humans has emerged in Wuhan, China which caused an unprecedented pandemic involving at least 185 countries infecting 2.5 million people till date. This virus is transmitted directly or indirectly through the upper aerodigestive tract. As it is evident from the recent studies that SARS-CoV-2 requires host enzyme Furin to activate receptor binding domain of its S protein and host Angiotensin Convertase Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is required as binding receptor, facilitating the entry of virus into the host cell. Evidence from literature shows that oral cancer tissues as well as paracarcinoma tissue exhibit higher expression of both Furin and ACE2, giving rise to the hypothesis that patients with oral cancer have higher chances of SARS CoV2 infection. It is also hypothesised that there will be increased severity of disease due to facilitated entry of the virus into the cells. Therefore, we suggest oral cancer patients require extra attention during COVID-19 pandemic and re-evaluation of current treatment paradigms in oral oncology is also needed.
Lived experiences of the corona survivors (patients admitted in COVID wards): A narrative real-life documented summaries of internalized guilt, shame, stigma, anger;COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a disaster for the human beings. All the Governments across the globe have been preparing to deal with this medical emergency, which is known to be associated with mortality in about 5% of the sufferers. Gradually, it is seen that, many patients with COVID-19 infection have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. Due to the risk of infecting others, persons with COVID-19 infection are kept in isolation wards. Because of the isolation, the fear of death, and associated stigma, many patients with COVID-19 infection go through mental distress. In this report, we discuss the experience of 3 persons diagnosed with COVId-19 infection and admitted to the COVID ward.
A dynamic modeling tool for estimating healthcare demand from the COVID19 epidemic and evaluating population-wide interventions;Public health officials need tools to assist in anticipating the healthcare resources required to confront the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. We constructed a modeling tool to aid active public health officials to estimate healthcare demand from the pandemic in their jurisdictions and to evaluate the potential impact of population-wide social-distancing interventions.
Evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 outside Hubei province, China: a descriptive and modelling study;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in Wuhan city, Hubei province, in December, 2019, and has spread throughout China. Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy.
The effectiveness of quarantine and isolation determine the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic in the final phase of the current outbreak in China;Since January 23, 2020, stringent measures for controlling the novel coronavirus epidemic have been gradually enforced and strengthened in mainland China. The detection and diagnosis have been improved, as well. However, the daily reported cases remaining at a high level make the epidemic trend prediction difficult.
Determination of the optimal penetration factor for evaluating the invasion process of aerosols from a confined source space to an uncontaminated area;Due to the outbreak and spread of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 has been proven to survive in aerosols for hours. Virus-containing aerosols may intrude into an uncontaminated area from a confined source space under certain ventilated conditions. The penetration factor, which is the most direct parameter for evaluating the invasion process, can effectively reflect the penetration fraction of aerosols and the shielding efficiency of buildings. Based on the observed concentrations of aerosols combined with a widely used concentration model, four numerical calculations of the penetration factor are proposed in this study. A theoretical time-correction 
Dealing with Corona virus anxiety and OCD;The world is reeling under the crisis caused by corona virus disease (COVID-19), print, electronic and social media are flooded with numerous advisories issued by governments and other national & international agencies. While all this is being done with best of intentions so as to contain the spread of this viral disease, this is causing a significant negative impact on mental health of people specially person of obsessive-compulsive disorder with fear of contamination and excessive washing of hands.
Medical mask versus cotton mask for preventing respiratory droplet transmission in micro environments;The objective of this study was to investigate whether cotton mask worn by respiratory infection person could suppress respiratory droplet levels compared to medical mask. We recruited adult volunteers with confirmed influenza and suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to wear medical masks and self-designed triple-layer cotton masks in a regular bedroom and a car with air conditioning. Four 1-hour repeated measurements (two measurements for bedroom the others for car) of particles with a size range of 20–1000 nm measured by number concentrations (NC
Quarantine Measures for Coronavirus Disease 2019 on a Cruise Ship, Taiwan, February 2020;To early detect and prevent coronavirus disease 2019 from spreading via international cruise ships, Taiwan Central Epidemic Command Center implemented on-board quarantine measures on a cruise ship at Port of Keelung, Taiwan, on February 8, 2020. Quarantine officers, medical professionals and administrative staff of competent authorities conducted fever screening, investigated present illness and travel history of 1,738 passengers and 776 crew members on the ship. Throat swabs were collected from 128 (5.1%) passengers and crew members with fever or respiratory symptoms in the past 14 days or travel history to China, Hong Kong or Macao within 30 days. All swabs tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by the national reference laboratory. The whole process, from on-board preparation to completion of testing, took 9 hours. All passengers and crew were permitted to disembark and were required to take mandatory 14-day self-health management measures. No cases were reported by the end of self-health management period.
The relationship between cyclonic weather regimes and seasonal influenza over the Eastern Mediterranean;The prediction of the occurrence of infectious diseases is of crucial importance for public health, as clearly seen in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we analyze the relationship between the occurrence of a winter low-pressure weather regime - Cyprus Lows - and the seasonal Influenza in the Eastern Mediterranean. We find that the weekly occurrence of Cyprus Lows is significantly correlated with clinical seasonal Influenza in Israel in recent years (
“Exercise with facemask;Straying away from a sedentary lifestyle is essential, especially in these troubled times of a global pandemic to reverse the ill effects associated with the health risks as mentioned earlier. In the view of anticipated effects on immune system and prevention against influenza and Covid-19, globally moderate to vigorous exercises are advocated wearing protective equipment such as facemasks. Though WHO supports facemasks only for Covid-19 patients, healthy “social exercisers” too exercise strenuously with customized facemasks or N95 which hypothesized to pose more significant health risks and tax various physiological systems especially pulmonary, circulatory and immune systems. Exercising with facemasks may reduce available Oxygen and increase air trapping preventing substantial carbon dioxide exchange. The hypercapnic hypoxia may potentially increase acidic environment, cardiac overload, anaerobic metabolism and renal overload, which may substantially aggravate the underlying pathology of established chronic diseases. Further contrary to the earlier thought, no evidence exists to claim the facemasks during exercise offer additional protection from the droplet transfer of the virus. Hence, we recommend social distancing is better than facemasks during exercise and optimal utilization rather than exploitation of facemasks during exercise.
Time to strengthen capacity in infectious disease control at the European level;The COVID-19 pandemic has made the European Commission revaluate its role in member states health systems. In response, the European Union is planning to significantly increase investment to tackle cross-border health threats. The European Centre for Communicable Disease Prevention and Control is well positioned to capitalise upon this increased investment by designing and implementing a renewed European strategy for infection disease control. To secure meaningful and sustainable improvements, the European Centre for Communicable Disease Prevention and Control needs to be strengthened with more resources, an expanded geographical scope and legislative change.
Changes of NOx in urban air detected with monitoring VIS-NIR field spectrometer during the coronavirus pandemic: A case study in Germany;The global outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic has led to a significant reduction of traffic and traffic-related urban air pollution. One important pollutant in this context is NO2. Sudden change in NO2 emissions related to reduction of urban traffic due to infection protection measures can be detected in Düsseldorf, Germany with continuous measurements of down-welling light with a RoX automated field-spectrometer. In comparison to a nearby reference instrument, a waveband around 590 nm was identified as significant for the retrieval in the VIS-NIR spectral range. A decision tree based on principal components which were decomposed from down-welling radiance spectra has been the most robust approach to retrieved NO2 values. Better differentiation of the NO2 value-range is achieved with a partial least square regression model. The results suggest that traffic-related changes of NOx pollution in urban air can be detected through continuous down-welling radiance measurements with inexpensive automated field-spectrometer systems.
A simple, inexpensive method for gas-phase singlet oxygen generation from sensitizer-impregnated filters: Potential application to bacteria/virus inactivation and pollutant degradation;Airborne infectious diseases such as the new Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pose serious threat to human health. Indoor air pollution is a problem of global environmental concern as well. Singlet oxygen (
A cross-sectional study on mental health among health care workers during the outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019;The spread of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global major public health event, threatening people's physical and mental health and even life safety. This study is to investigate the psychological abnormality in health care workers battling the COVID-19 epidemic and to explore the associations among social support, resilience and mental health. A total of 1521 health care workers, of whom 147 had public health emergency experience while 1374 showed no experience, completed the Symptom Check-List-90 (SCL-90), Chinese version of Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC) and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). χ
Human coronavirus data from four clinical trials of masks and respirators;There are few published data on the efficacy of masks or respirators against coronavirus infections. This is an important research question to inform the response to the COVID-19 epidemic. The transmission modes of human coronaviruses are similar, thought to be by droplet, contact, and sometimes airborne routes. There are several randomized clinical trials of masks and respirators, but most used clinical endpoints or tested only for influenza. In four trials that we conducted, we tested for human coronaviruses, but only composite viral endpoints were reported in the trials. We reviewed and analyzed the coronavirus data from four of our trials. Laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infections were identified in our community household trial (one case), health worker trials (eight cases), and trial of mask use by sick patients (19 cases). No coronavirus infections were transmitted in households to parents who wore P2 or surgical masks, but one child with coronavirus infection transmitted infection to a parent in the control arm. No transmissions to close contacts occurred when worn by sick patients with coronavirus infections. There was a higher risk of coronavirus infection in HCWs who wore a mask compared to a respirator, but the difference was not statistically significant. These are the only available clinical trial data on coronavirus infections associated with mask or respirator use. More clinical trials are needed to assess the efficacy of respiratory protection against coronavirus infections.
Can neuromodulation support the fight against the COVID19 pandemic? Transcutaneous non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation as a potential targeted treatment of fulminant acute respiratory distress syndrome;The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread all over the world and caused a major health care crisis. About 20% of patients develop severe disease and require hospitalisation, which is associated with a high mortality rate of up to 97% in those being ventilated and respiratory failure being the leading cause of death. Despite many therapeutic agents being under current investigation there is yet no panacea available. With increasing rates of infection throughout the world, there is an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches to counteract the infection.
The possible immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in coronavirus disease patients;While researchers are struggling to develop a vaccine for coronavirus disease, it is important to evolve effective therapeutic strategies to save lives. The majority of coronavirus disease deaths are due to pneumonia. Mostly, stress and depression are associated with coronavirus disease infection and thus, resulting in weakening of patients’ immune response and hence, more severe respiratory symptoms or even death. We propose using a class of antidepressants named selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for their reported potential antiviral effect, modulatory effect of respiratory symptoms, antioxidant properties and immunoregulatory effects beside their main action as antidepressant. In addition, the low cost of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors might add a benefit for coronavirus disease patients.
Challenges and solutions for addressing critical shortage of supply chain for personal and protective equipment (PPE) arising from Coronavirus disease (COVID19) pandemic – Case study from the Republic of Ireland;Coronavirus (COVID-19) is highly infectious agent that causes fatal respiratory illnesses, which is of great global public health concern. Currently, there is no effective vaccine for tackling this COVID19 pandemic where disease countermeasures rely upon preventing or slowing person-to-person transmission. Specifically, there is increasing efforts to prevent or reduce transmission to front-line healthcare workers (HCW). However, there is growing international concern regarding the shortage in supply chain of critical one-time-use personal and protective equipment (PPE). PPE are heat sensitive and are not, by their manufacturer's design, intended for reprocessing. Most conventional sterilization technologies used in hospitals, or in terminal medical device sterilization providers, cannot effectively reprocess PPE due to the nature and severity of sterilization modalities. Contingency planning for PPE stock shortage is important. Solutions in the Republic of Ireland include use of smart communication channels to improve supply chain, bespoke production of PPE to meets gaps, along with least preferred option, use of sterilization or high-level disinfection for PPE reprocessing. Reprocessing PPE must consider material composition, functionality post treatment, along with appropriate disinfection. Following original manufacturer of PPE and regulatory guidance is important. Technologies deployed in the US, and for deployment in the Republic of Ireland, are eco-friendly, namely vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VH2O2), such as for filtering facepiece respirators and UV irradiation and High-level liquid disinfection (Actichlor+) is also been pursed in Ireland. Safeguarding supply chain of PPE will sustain vital healthcare provision and will help reduce mortality.
Does lockdown reduce air pollution? Evidence from 44 cities in northern China;Responding to the ongoing novel coronavirus (agent of COVID-19) outbreak, China implemented “the largest quarantine in human history” in Wuhan on 23 January 2020. Similar quarantine measures were imposed on other Chinese cities within days. Human mobility and relevant production and consumption activities have since decreased significantly. As a likely side effect of this decrease, many regions have recorded significant reductions in air pollution. We employed daily air pollution data and Intracity Migration Index (IMI) data form Baidu between 1 January and 21 March 2020 for 44 cities in northern China to examine whether, how, and to what extent travel restrictions affected air quality. On the basis of this quantitative analysis, we reached the following conclusions: (1) The reduction of air pollution was strongly associated with travel restrictions during this pandemic—on average, the air quality index (AQI) decreased by 7.80%, and five air pollutants (i.e., SO
Fangcang shelter hospitals: a novel concept for responding to public health emergencies;Fangcang shelter hospitals are a novel public health concept. They were implemented for the first time in China in February, 2020, to tackle the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The Fangcang shelter hospitals in China were large-scale, temporary hospitals, rapidly built by converting existing public venues, such as stadiums and exhibition centres, into health-care facilities. They served to isolate patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 from their families and communities, while providing medical care, disease monitoring, food, shelter, and social activities. We document the development of Fangcang shelter hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in China and explain their three key characteristics (rapid construction, massive scale, and low cost) and five essential functions (isolation, triage, basic medical care, frequent monitoring and rapid referral, and essential living and social engagement). Fangcang shelter hospitals could be powerful components of national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as future epidemics and public health emergencies.
Modelling SARS-COV2 Spread in London: Approaches to Lift the Lockdown;To use mathematical models to predict the epidemiological impact of lifting the lockdown in London, UK, and alternative strategies to help inform policy in the UK.
Intermittent occupancy combined with ventilation: An efficient strategy for the reduction of airborne transmission indoors;It is important that efficient measures to reduce the airborne transmission of respiratory infectious diseases (including COVID-19) should be formulated as soon as possible to ensure a safe easing of lockdown. Ventilation has been widely recognized as an efficient engineering control measure for airborne transmission. Room ventilation with an increased supply of clean outdoor air could dilute the expiratory airborne aerosols to a lower concentration level. However, sufficient increase is beyond the capacity of most of the existing mechanical ventilation systems that were designed to be energy efficient under non-pandemic conditions. We propose an improved control strategy based on source control, which would be achieved by implementing intermittent breaks in room occupancy, specifically that all occupants should leave the room periodically and the room occupancy time should be reduced as much as possible. Under the assumption of good mixing of clean outdoor supply air with room air, the evolution of the concentration in the room of aerosols exhaled by infected person(s) is predicted. The risk of airborne cross-infection is then evaluated by calculating the time-averaged intake fraction. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated for a case study of a typical classroom. This strategy, together with other control measures such as continuous supply of maximum clean air, distancing, face-to-back layout of workstations and reducing activities that increase aerosol generation (e.g., loudly talking and singing), is applicable in classrooms, offices, meeting rooms, conference rooms, etc.
Pollen likely seasonal factor in inhibiting flu-like epidemics. A Dutch study into the inverse relation between pollen counts, hay fever and flu-like incidence 2016–2019;There is uncertainty if current models for the Covid-19 pandemic should already take into account seasonality. That is because current environmental factors do not provide a powerful explanation of such seasonality, especially given climate differences between countries with moderate climates. It is hypothesized that one major factor is overlooked: pollen count. Pollen are documented to invoke strong immune responses and might create an environmental factor that makes it more difficult for flu-like viruses to survive outside a host. This Dutch study confirms that there is a (highly) significant inverse correlation between pollen count and weekly changes in medical flu consults, and that there is a highly significant inverse correlation between hay fever incidence, as measured by prescribed medication revenues, and weekly flu consults. This supports the idea that pollen are a direct or indirect factor in the seasonality of flu-like epidemics. If seasonality will be observed during the covid-19 spread as well, it is not unlikely that pollen play a role.
Lockdown for CoViD-2019 in Milan: What are the effects on air quality?;Based on the rapid spread of the CoViD-2019, a lockdown was declared in the whole Northern Italy by the Government. The application of increasingly rigorous containment measures allowed to reduce the impact of the CoViD-2019 pandemic on the Italian National Health System but at the same time these restriction measures gave also the opportunity to assess the effect of anthropogenic activities on air pollutants in an unprecedented way. This paper aims to study the impact of the partial and total lockdown (PL and TL, respectively) on air quality in the Metropolitan City of Milan. As results, the severe limitation of people movements following the PL and the subsequent TL determined a significant reduction of pollutants concentration mainly due to vehicular traffic (PM
Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis;In the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.
Artificial intelligence and the future of global health;Concurrent advances in information technology infrastructure and mobile computing power in many low and middle-income countries (LMICs) have raised hopes that artificial intelligence (AI) might help to address challenges unique to the field of global health and accelerate achievement of the health-related sustainable development goals. A series of fundamental questions have been raised about AI-driven health interventions, and whether the tools, methods, and protections traditionally used to make ethical and evidence-based decisions about new technologies can be applied to AI. Deployment of AI has already begun for a broad range of health issues common to LMICs, with interventions focused primarily on communicable diseases, including tuberculosis and malaria. Types of AI vary, but most use some form of machine learning or signal processing. Several types of machine learning methods are frequently used together, as is machine learning with other approaches, most often signal processing. AI-driven health interventions fit into four categories relevant to global health researchers: (1) diagnosis, (2) patient morbidity or mortality risk assessment, (3) disease outbreak prediction and surveillance, and (4) health policy and planning. However, much of the AI-driven intervention research in global health does not describe ethical, regulatory, or practical considerations required for widespread use or deployment at scale. Despite the field remaining nascent, AI-driven health interventions could lead to improved health outcomes in LMICs. Although some challenges of developing and deploying these interventions might not be unique to these settings, the global health community will need to work quickly to establish guidelines for development, testing, and use, and develop a user-driven research agenda to facilitate equitable and ethical use.
Bioaerosol emissions from activated sludge basins: Characterization, release, and attenuation;This article presents a critical review of the peer-reviewed literature related to bioaerosol generation from activated sludge basins. Characterization techniques include a variety of culture- and nonculture-based techniques, each with unique features. Bioaerosols contain a variety of clinical pathogens including 
Molecular identification of ;A 31-year-old man presented with cryptococcal meningitis (CM) without typical clinical characteristics, but with abnormal walking, difficult leg lifting and frequent falling. He was admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital. After multiple tests failed to identify the pathogen, single-cell sequencing (scS) was used to test the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Comparing the sequence obtained from single-cell sequencing with the reference database, it was found that the infection was caused by 
Encephalopathy in severe SARS-CoV2 infection: Inflammatory or infectious?;Concerning the letter by Moriguchi et al., we describe our experience with a case of encephalopathy with and atypical damage on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a patient with severe infection due to the SARS-CoV2 virus. A 56-year-old woman, without previous pathologies, developed cough, fever, and respiratory failure for five days, after returning from a 6-day trip to Venice. Chest radiography shows a large bilateral interstitial infiltrate. In the first 24 hours, she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for severe respiratory failure and positive protein chain reaction-PCR in nasal exudate. She needed intubation for ten days. In the first 48 hours outside the ICU, she developed an acute confusional syndrome (hyperactive delirium). Neurological examination showed temporal-spatial disorientation and incoherent fluent speech.
Performance and Acceptability of Self-Collected HPV Testing Among Women Living with HIV;To assess the validity, reliability, and acceptability of self-collected HPV tests in U.S. women living with HIV (WLHIV).
Bioaerosol sampling optimization for community exposure assessment in cities with poor sanitation: A one health cross-sectional study;Evidence of exposure to enteric pathogens through the air and associated risk of infection is scarce in the literature outside of animal- or human-waste handling settings. Cities with poor sanitation are important locations to investigate this aerial exposure pathway as their rapid growth will pose unprecedented challenges in waste management. To address this issue, simple surveillance methods are needed. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to optimize a community exposure bioaerosol surveillance strategy for urban outdoor locations with poor sanitation, and to determine which bioaerosols could contribute to exposure. Passive and active bioaerosol sampling methods were used to characterize the fate and transport of sanitation-related bioaerosols during the rainy and dry seasons in La Paz, Bolivia. Median coliform bacteria fluxes were 71 CFU/(m
Multi-route respiratory infection: When a transmission route may dominate;The exact transmission route of many respiratory infectious diseases remains a subject for debate to date. The relative contribution ratio of each transmission route is largely undetermined, which is affected by environmental conditions, human behaviour, the host and the microorganism. In this study, a detailed mathematical model is developed to investigate the relative contributions of different transmission routes to a multi-route transmitted respiratory infection. The following transmission routes are considered: long-range airborne transmission, short-range airborne transmission, direction inhalation of medium droplets or droplet nuclei, direct deposition of droplets of all sizes, direct and indirect contact route. It is illustrated that all transmission routes can dominate the total transmission risk under different scenarios. Influential parameters considered include the dose-response rate of different routes, droplet governing size that determines pathogen content in droplets, exposure distance, and pathogen dose transported to the hand of infector. Our multi-route transmission model provided a comprehensive but straightforward method to evaluate the probability of respiratory diseases transmission via different routes. It also established a basis for predicting the impact of individual-level intervention methods such as increasing close-contact distance and wearing protective masks.
A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster;An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.
The risk of respiratory tract infections and interstitial lung disease with IL-12/23 and IL-23 antagonists in patients with autoimmune diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis;Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and interstitial lung disease (ILD) secondary to interleukin (IL)-12/23 or IL-23 antagonists have been reported in autoimmune diseases.
Anatomic evidence shows that lymphatic drainage exists in the pituitary to loop the cerebral lymphatic circulation;Respiratory infections can result in intracranial infections and unknown neurological symptoms. The central nervous system lacks classical meningeal lymphatic (circulation) drainage, and the exact underlying mechanisms of how immune cells from the peripheral lymphatic system enter the central nervous system (CNS) remain unknown.
Sustainable food transition in Portugal: Assessing the footprint of dietary choices and gaps in national and local food policies;The food system is increasingly acknowledged as the single largest reason for humans' transgression of key planetary limits and it is gaining centrality in our societal run-up towards a sustainable future, especially at city level. In Portugal, a country characterized by high meat and fish consumption, noticeable food wastage, and high urbanization level, fully understanding and then transforming the food system is of priority. Here we investigate the significance of food in comparison to other daily anthropogenic demands and the current sourcing and resource intensities profiles of dietary patterns at Portuguese national and city level through Ecological Footprint Accounting. A critical assessment of gaps in national and local food policies to trigger a major transformation in the Portuguese food system is also conducted on the basis of a newly proposed analytical framework.
Pneumonia in children admitted to the national referral hospital in Bhutan: A prospective cohort study;The study aim was to describe the etiological profile and clinical characteristics of pneumonia among children hospitalized in Thimphu, Bhutan.
Health sector spending and spending on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and development assistance for health: progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 3;Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 aims to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”. While a substantial effort has been made to quantify progress towards SDG3, less research has focused on tracking spending towards this goal. We used spending estimates to measure progress in financing the priority areas of SDG3, examine the association between outcomes and financing, and identify where resource gains are most needed to achieve the SDG3 indicators for which data are available.
Efficient removal of water bacteria and viruses using electrospun nanofibers;Pathogenic contamination has been considered as a significant worldwide water quality concern. Due to providing promising opportunities for the production of nanocomposite membranes with tailored porosity, adjustable pore size, and scaled-up ability of biomolecules incorporation, electrospinning has become the center of attention. This review intends to provide a detailed summary of the recent advances in the fabrication of antibacterial and antiviral electrospun nanofibers and discuss their application efficiency as a water filtration membrane. The current review attempts to give a functionalist perspective of the fundamental progress in construction strategies of antibacterial and antiviral electrospun nanofibers. The review provides a list of antibacterial and antiviral agents commonly used as water membrane filters and discusses the challenges in the incorporation process. We have thoroughly studied the recent application of functionalized electrospun nanofibers in the water disinfection process, with an emphasis on their efficiency. Moreover, different antibacterial and antiviral assay techniques for membranes are discussed, the gaps and limitations are highlighted and promising strategies to overcome barriers are studies.
Assessing climate-induced agricultural vulnerable coastal communities of Bangladesh using machine learning techniques;The agricultural arena in the coastal regions of South-East Asian countries is experiencing the mounting pressures of the adverse effects of climate change. Controlling and predicting climatic factors are difficult and require expensive solutions. The study focuses on identifying issues other than climatic factors using the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) to measure agricultural vulnerability. Factors such as monthly savings of the farmers, income opportunities, damage to cultivable lands, and water availability had significant impacts on increasing community vulnerability with regards to agricultural practice. The study also identified the need for assessing vulnerability after certain intervals, specifically owing to the dynamic nature of the coastal region where the factors were found to vary among the different study areas. The development of a climate-resilient livelihood vulnerability assessment tool to detect the most significant factors to assess agricultural vulnerability was done using machine learning (ML) techniques. The ML techniques identified nine significant factors out of 21 based on the minimum level of standard deviation (0.03). A practical application of the outcome of the study was the development of a mobile application. Custom REST APIs (application programming interface) were developed on the backend to seamlessly sync the app to a server, thus ensuring the acquisition of future data without much effort and resources. The paper provides a methodology for a unique vulnerability assessment technique using a mobile application, which can be used for the planning and management of resources by different stakeholders in a sustainable way.
Implementation of Surgical Site Infection Surveillance in Low- and Middle-Income Countries A Position Statement for the International Society for Infectious Diseases;Surgical site infection (SSI) rates in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) range from 8 to 30% of procedures, making them the most common healthcare acquired infection (HAI) with substantial morbidity, mortality, and economic impacts. Presented here is an approach to surgical site infection prevention based on surveillance and focused on five key areas as identified by international experts. These five areas include:
Multi-biomarker responses to pesticides in an agricultural population from Central Brazil;We evaluated farmworkers exposed to pesticides and individuals with no history of occupational exposure to pesticides. It was performed the comet assay to evaluate DNA damage. The immunophenotyping of TCD4+ lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood was performed by flow cytometry. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PON1, XRCC1, IL6, IL6R, TNF-α, and MIR137 genes were evaluated by real-time PCR. The exposed group was composed mostly by males (69.44%), with direct exposure to pesticides (56%) and with an average age range of 46 ± 13.89 years, being that 58.3% of farmworkers directly exposed to pesticides and reported the full use of personal protective equipment (PPE). DNA damage was greater in the exposed group (p < 0.05), reinforced by the use of PPE to denote a lower degree of DNA damage (p = 0.002). In this context, in the exposed group, we demonstrated that the use of PPE, age, gender and intoxication events were the variables that most contributed to increase DNA damage (p < 0.0001). Besides, the exposed group showed a significant increase in the subpopulations of T lymphocytes CD3
The ‘;The funeral industry is a potential reservoir of antibiotic resistance. The occurrence, human exposure and health risks of antibiotic resistance in the funeral industry were examined. The funeral industry harbours antibiotic resistance to multiple common and last-resort antibiotics, hence constitutes the ‘
Sustainable soil use and management: An interdisciplinary and systematic approach;Soil is a key component of Earth's critical zone. It provides essential services for agricultural production, plant growth, animal habitation, biodiversity, carbon sequestration and environmental quality, which are crucial for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, soil degradation has occurred in many places throughout the world due to factors such as soil pollution, erosion, salinization, and acidification. In order to achieve the SDGs by the target date of 2030, soils may need to be used and managed in a manner that is more sustainable than is currently practiced. Here we show that research in the field of sustainable soil use and management should prioritize the multifunctional value of soil health and address interdisciplinary linkages with major issues such as biodiversity and climate change. As soil is the largest terrestrial carbon pool, as well as a significant contributor of greenhouse gases, much progress can be made toward curtailing the climate crisis by sustainable soil management practices. One identified option is to increase soil organic carbon levels, especially with recalcitrant forms of carbon (e.g., biochar application). In general, soil health is primarily determined by the actions of the farming community. Therefore, information management and knowledge sharing are necessary to improve the sustainable behavior of practitioners and end-users. Scientists and policy makers are important actors in this social learning process, not only to disseminate evidence-based scientific knowledge, but also in generating new knowledge in close collaboration with farmers. While governmental funding for soil data collection has been generally decreasing, newly available 5G telecommunications, big data and machine learning based data collection and analytical tools are maturing. Interdisciplinary studies that incorporate such advances may lead to the formation of innovative sustainable soil use and management strategies that are aimed toward optimizing soil health and achieving the SDGs.
Exceedances and trends of particulate matter (PM;Fine particulate matter (PM
;Low Impact Developments (LIDs) employ a series of vegetative techniques to retain rainfall close to the site of origin. Although LIDs offer sustainable runoff management, these infrastructures can be considered a risk to public health due to the presence of pathogens in the runoff and human exposure to contaminated water held in and transported by LIDs. The objective of this study is to examine the disease burden of Gastrointestinal illness (GI) from exposure to LIDs at the residential, neighbourhood, and municipal levels. The authors conducted a meta-analysis of literature on three water features: (1) harvested rainwater obtained from LIDs, (2) surface water, and (3) floodwater. A set of 32 studies were systematically selected to collect values of risks of infection and expressed as the disease burden, i.e. disability adjusted life years (DALYs). The results showed that the percentage of GI illness exceeding the health guidelines were high for harvested rainwater, i.e. 22% of annual disease burden exceeded the WHO guidelines (0.001 DALYs/1000 persons), and 2% exceeded the US EPA guidelines (5.75 DALYs/1000 bathers). Among the six exposures for harvested rainwater, exposure to spray irrigation, exceeded US EPA guidelines whereas
Implementing on-site construction waste recycling in Hong Kong: Barriers and facilitators;Construction and demolition (C&D) waste recycling constitutes an indispensable component in the overall waste management strategy. Unlike the traditional recycling approaches whereby C&D waste is transported to off-site facilities for treatment, construction managers are actively exploring the possibility of on-site recycling where C&D waste is treated directly at source. This study reports the barriers and facilitators of implementing on-site C&D waste recycling by contextualizing it in Hong Kong. It does so by adopting a mixed-method approach combining case study, site visits, and interviews. It is discovered that the barriers include (1) site space constraints, (2) narrow window of opportunity to trade recycled products, (3) vulnerable business case, (4) lack of support from off-site recycling, and (5) lack of government policy support. A series of facilitating measures are also proposed, including (1) developing customized on-site recycling equipment, (2) establishing a demand-supply information-sharing platform, (3) developing more thriving off-site recycling, and (4) providing more government support. This study probes into the real-life on- and off-site waste recycling practices in Hong Kong's prominent C&D management system. It can also provide useful references for others in developing their own C&D waste recycling strategies by rationally deploying on- and off-site recycling.
The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: rapid review of the evidence;The December, 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak has seen many countries ask people who have potentially come into contact with the infection to isolate themselves at home or in a dedicated quarantine facility. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence. We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review. Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.
On biological evolution and environmental solutions;Drawing insights from multiple disciplines is essential for finding integrative solutions that are required to tackle complex environmental problems. Human activities are causing unprecedented influence on global ecosystems, culminating in the loss of species and fundamental changes in the selective environments of organisms across the tree of life. Our collective understanding about biological evolution can help identify and mitigate many of the environmental problems in the Anthropocene. To this end, we propose a stronger integration of environmental sciences with evolutionary biology.

Greening and legume-supported crop rotations: An impacts assessment on Italian arable farms;Since the 1990s, the European Union has progressively and structurally reformed the Common Agricultural Policy with a gradual integration of environmental objectives. For the period post-2020, one of the most relevant changes could be the upgrading of the crops diversification, imposing it as an obligation to rotate crops by introducing legumes in the cropping patterns. This paper proposes an assessment of the possible effects of such obligation on the arable crops sector in Italy.
Vitamin E acetate as linactant in the pathophysiology of EVALI;The recent identification of Vitamin E acetate as one of the causal agents for the e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI) is a major milestone. In membrane biophysics, Vitamin E is a linactant and a potent modulator of lateral phase separation that effectively reduces the line tension at the two-dimensional phase boundaries and thereby exponentially increases the surface viscosity of the pulmonary surfactant. Disrupted dynamics of respiratory compression-expansion cycling may result in an extensive hypoxemia, leading to an acute respiratory distress entailing the formation of intraalveolar lipid-laden macrophages. Supplementation of pulmonary surfactants which retain moderate level of cholesterol and controlled hypothermia for patients are recommended when the hypothesis that the line-active property of the vitamin derivative drives the pathogenesis of EVALI holds.
;Chronic and emerging infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance remain a substantial global health threat. Microbiota are increasingly recognised to play an important role in health. Infections also have a profound effect beyond health, especially on global and local economies. To maximise health improvements, the field of infectious disease epidemiology needs to derive learning from ecology and traditional epidemiology. New methodologies and tools are transforming understanding of these systems, from a better understanding of socioeconomic, environmental, and cultural drivers of infection, to improved methods to detect microorganisms, describe the immunome, and understand the role of human microbiota. However, exploiting the potential of novel methods to improve global health remains elusive. We argue that to exploit these advances a shift is required in the teaching of infectious disease epidemiology to ensure that students are well versed in a breadth of disciplines, while maintaining core epidemiological skills. We discuss the following key points using a series of teaching vignettes: (1) integrated training in classic and novel techniques is needed to develop future scientists and professionals who can work from the micro (interactions between pathogens, their cohabiting microbiota, and the host at a molecular and cellular level), with the meso (the affected communities), and to the macro (wider contextual drivers of disease)
Needs assessment for novel Gram-negative antibiotics in US hospitals: a retrospective cohort study;Evidence-based needs assessments for novel antibiotics against highly-resistant Gram-negative infections (GNIs) are scarce. We aimed to use real-world data from an electronic health record repository to identify treatment opportunities in US hospitals for GNIs resistant to all first-line drugs.
Development and multi-objective optimization of a newly proposed industrial heat recovery based cascaded hydrogen and ammonia synthesis system;The industrial flue gas emitted to the atmosphere is considered not only harmful to the environment but also a waste of plentiful resources of thermal energy. The thermal energy extracted from the industrial flue gas can be employed for multiple purposes. This study proposes a new configuration to integrate the thermal management of industrial flue gas for thermochemical copper-chlorine (Cu-Cl) cycle based ammonia synthesis. A reverse osmosis desalination unit is employed to supply the freshwater required by the thermochemical Cu-Cl cycle. To recover the heat from high-temperature oxygen stream, thermoelectric generators (TEGs) and organic Rankine cycle (ORC) are integrated with the proposed configuration to utilize the low-grade waste heat for power production. A portion of produced hydrogen through the thermochemical Cu-Cl cycle is supplied to the cascaded system for ammonia production. A double-stage cascaded ammonia synthesis system is integrated with the proposed configuration to achieve high fractional conversion. A multi-objective optimization using genetic algorithm is implemented to the proposed system using the MATLAB to investigate and determine the best-operating temperatures and pressures for the ammonia synthesis system. The proposed configuration produces 518.4 kmol/day of hydrogen and 226.8 kmol/day of ammonia. The overall exergetic and energetic efficiencies are found to be 28.7% and 40.8%. Moreover, the results obtained from the comprehensive sensitivity analyses are presented and discussed.
Cleaning the River Ganga: Impact of lockdown on water quality and future implications on river rejuvenation strategies;Clean rivers and healthy aquatic life symbolize that the ecosystem is functioning well. The Ganga River has shown signs of rejuvenation and a significant improvement on many parameters, following the eight-week nationwide lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic. Since industrial units and commercial establishments were closed, water was not being lifted by them with a negligible discharge of industrial wastewater. It was observed that during the lockdown period most of the districts falling under the Ganga basin observed 60% excess rainfall than the normal, which led to increased discharge in the river, further contributing towards the dilution of pollutants. Further, data analysis of live storages in the Ganga Basin revealed that the storage during the beginning of the third phase of lockdown was almost double than the storage during the same period the previous year. Analysis of the storage data of the last ten years revealed that the storage till May 6, 2020 was 82.83% more than the average of the previous ten years, which meant that more water was available for the river during the lockdown period. The impact could be seen in terms of increased dissolved oxygen (DO) and reduced biological oxygen demand (BOD), Faecal coliform, Total coliform and nitrate (NO
An emerging class of air pollutants: Potential effects of microplastics to respiratory human health?;It is increasingly recognized that the ubiquity of convenient single-use plastic has resulted in a global plastic pollution challenge, with substantial environmental and health consequences. Physical, chemical, and biological processes result in plastic weathering, with eventual formation of debris in the micro to nano size range. There is an increasing awareness that plastic fragments are dispersed in the air and can be inhaled by humans, which may cause adverse effects on the respiratory system and on other systems. Urban environments are often characterized by high concentrations of fine airborne dust from various sources. To date, however, there is limited information on the distribution, shape, and size of microplastics in the air in urban and other environments. In this article, we review and discuss our current understanding of the exposure characteristics of airborne plastic debris in urbanized areas, focusing on concentration, size, morphology, presence of additives and distributions of different polymers. The natural and extend data are compiled and compared to laboratory-based analyses to further our understanding of the potential adverse effects of inhaled plastic particles on human health.
Ultrafast physical bacterial inactivation and photocatalytic self-cleaning of ZnO nanoarrays for rapid and sustainable bactericidal applications;Various nanostructured surfaces have been developed recently to physically inactivate bacteria, for reducing the rapidly spreading threat of pathogenic bacteria. However, it generally takes several hours for these surfaces to inactivate most of the bacteria, which greatly limits their application in the fields favoring rapid bactericidal performance. Besides, the accumulated bacteria debris left on these surfaces is rarely discussed in the previous reports. Herein we report the nanotip-engineered ZnO nanoarrays (NAs) with ultrafast physical bactericidal rate and the ability to photocatalytically remove the bacteria debris. Neither chemical (Zn
Marburg Virus Disease: a Summary for Clinicians;This article is a summary of countermeasures for Marburg virus disease focusing on pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnostics, with an emphasis on therapies and vaccines that have demonstrated potential for use in an emergency situation, through their evaluation in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and/or in humans.
Use of teledermatology by dermatology hospitalists is effective in the diagnosis and management of inpatient disease.;Patient outcomes are improved when dermatologists provide inpatient consults. Inpatient access to dermatologists is limited, illustrating an opportunity to utilize teledermatology. Little is known about the ability of dermatologists to accurately diagnose and manage inpatients using teledermatology, particularly utilizing non-dermatologist generated clinical data.
Discovery of large molecules as new biomarkers in wastewater using environmental proteomics and suitable polymer probes;The capability of monitoring large molecules as possible biomarkers in wastewater will be an important contribution to the new field of sewage epidemiology. Here, we explore the use of polymer probes together with untargeted proteomics for large scale protein analysis in sewage and treated water. Polymeric probes were immersed in the influent, anoxic reactor and effluent waters of a Spanish WWTP during 11 days. Proteins sorbed were extracted and identified by mass spectrometry. A total of 690 proteins from bacteria, plants and animals, including human, were identified showing different proteome profiles in the different sites. Bacterial proteins (510) pointed at 175 genera distributed in 22 bacterial classes. The most abundant were EF-Tu, GroEL and ATP synthase which were contributed by a high number of species. Human was the species contributing the greatest number of identified proteins (57), some in high abundance like keratins. Human proteins dominated in the influent water and were efficiently removed at the effluent. Several of the proteins identified (S100A8, uromodulin, defensins) are known disease biomarkers. This study provides the first insight into the proteome profiles present in real wastewater.
;The extent of prescription and illicit drug abuse in geographically isolated rural and micropolitan communities in the intermountain western United States (US) has not been well tracked. The goal of this pilot study was to accurately measure drug dose consumption rates (DCR) between two select populations, normalize the data and compare the DCRs to similar communities. To learn about patterns of drug abuse between the two disparate communities, we used the emergent field of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). A rapid, quantitative and systematic process for the determination of multiple classes of prescribed and illicit drugs was applied to influent wastewater samples. Influent samples were collected over the course of three months (April to June 2019) at two wastewater treatment plants representing a small urban and a rural community. Collection of sewage influent included 24-h composite samples and the use of polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS), time-weighted samplers. Using the results from the composite sampling data, DCRs per 1000 population could be calculated from the concentration data and the use of excretion correction factors. The following 18 compounds: amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDA, MDMA, morphine, 6-acetylmorphine, methadone, EDDP, codeine, benzoylecgonine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, noroxycodone, ketamine, fluoxetine, tramadol, and ritalinic acid
Acute pancreatic injuries: A complication of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with cytotoxic immune cell activation;Complications involving internal organs are usually present in Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). However, pancreatic complications are rarely reported and studied.
Role of phototherapy in the era of biologics;Phototherapy is a safe and effective treatment for many dermatologic conditions. With the advent of novel biologics and small molecule inhibitors, it is important to critically evaluate the role of phototherapy in dermatology. Surveys have shown that many dermatology residency programs do not dedicate time to teaching residents how to prescribe or administer phototherapy. Limitations of phototherapy include access to a center, time required for treatments, and insurance approval. Home phototherapy, a viable option, is also underused. However, it should be emphasized that modern phototherapy has been in use for over 40 years, has an excellent safety profile, and does not require laboratory monitoring. It can be safely combined with many other treatment modalities, including biologics and small molecule inhibitors. In addition, phototherapy costs significantly less than these novel agents. Dermatologists are the only group of physicians who have the expertise and proper training to deliver this treatment modality to our patients. Therefore, to continue to deliver high-quality, cost-effective care, it is imperative that phototherapy be maintained as an integral part of the dermatology treatment armamentarium.
Competing PM;The holiday effect is a useful tool to estimate the impact on air pollution due to changes in human activities. In this study, we assessed the variations in concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM
The possible role of a bacterial aspartate β-decarboxylase in the biosynthesis of alamandine;The understanding of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has significantly expanded over the last two decades. The elucidation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that converts angiotensin (Ang) II into Ang (1–7) led to the discovery of the cardio-protective axis of the RAS. In addition, novel components of the system, Angiotensin A (Ang A) and alamandine have been identified. Like Ang (1–7), alamandine is a vasodilator and can counteract the effects of Ang II by increasing nitric oxide release from the endothelium and decreasing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH)-related superoxide production. Theoretically, alamandine can be derived from Ang (1–7) by decarboxylation of the N-terminal aspartic acid residue to alanine, but the enzyme responsible for this is still unknown. To date, no human or mammalian enzyme with the assigned decarboxylase activity has been identified. However, several bacterial enzymes capable of converting aspartate to alanine have been reported. Therefore, we hypothesize that a bacterial enzyme, most likely present in the microbiome of the gastrointestinal tract, the heart, or systemic circulation could metabolize Ang II, and/or Ang 1–7, to Ang A and alamandine, respectively, in mammals.
;In China, the corresponding control directives for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been based on primary emissions, rarely considering reactive speciation. To seek more effective VOCs control strategies, we investigated 107 VOC species in a typical coastal city (Beihai) of South China, from August to November 2018. Meanwhile, a high-resolution anthropogenic VOCs monthly emission inventory (EI) was established for 2018. For source apportionments (SAs) reliability, comparisons of source structures derived from positive matrix factorization (PMF) and EI were made mainly in terms of reaction losses, uncertainties and specific ratios. Finally, for the source–end control, a comprehensive reactivity control index (RCI) was established by combing SAs with reactive speciation profiles. Ambient measurements showed that the average concentration of VOCs was 26.38 ppbv, dominated by alkanes (36.7%) and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) (29.4%). VOC reactivity was estimated using ozone formation potential (52.35 ppbv) and propylene-equivalent concentration (4.22 ppbv). EI results displayed that the entire VOC, OFP, and propylene-equivalent emissions were 40.98 Gg, 67.98 Gg, and 105.93 Gg, respectively. Comparisons of source structures indicated that VOC SAs agreed within ±100% between two perspectives. Both PMF and EI results showed that petrochemical industry (24.0% and 33.0%), food processing and associated combustion (19.1% and 29.2%) were the significant contributors of anthropogenic VOCs, followed by other industrial processes (22.2% and 13.3%), transportation (18.9% and 12.0%), and solvent utilization (9.1% and10.5%). Aimed at VOCs abatement according to RCI: for terminal control, fifteen ambient highly reactive species (predominantly alkenes and alkanes) were targeted
On the linkage between urban heat island and urban pollution island: Three-decade literature review towards a conceptual framework;With the doubling of urban population within the next two decades and the disproportionate growth of megacities, it is critical to explore the synergism between urban heat and pollution. In this paper, a systematic review is conducted on the existing knowledge, collected since 1990, on the link between urban heat island (UHI) and urban pollution island (UPI). Results from 16 countries and 11 Köppen-Geiger climatic zones are perused and compared to delineate methodological and experimental trends, geographical dependencies and research gaps. Detailed content analysis is conducted according to five prominent topics: i) the role of UHI on temperature-dependent chemistry, ii) the daytime/nighttime variability in the UHI-UPI interaction, iii) the role of urban geomorphic types, forms and growth schemes, iv) future trends and v) primary and secondary effects of UHI mitigation on urban air quality. Different approaches and observations are eventually harmonized to outline opportunities and challenges towards the disentanglement and/or the two-way mitigation of both phenomena. This will help governments and urban planners to deliver coping strategies and precautions towards a more salutogenic urban design.
Urban environmental health interventions towards the Sustainable Development Goals;The aim of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030. Since the majority of the global population lives in cities, it is crucial to identify, evaluate and implement urban interventions (such as zero carbon housing, active transport, better urban connectivity, air pollution control, clean household fuels, and protection from heat and flood events) that will improve health and wellbeing and make our natural and built environment more sustainable. This Virtual Special Issue (VSI) comprises of 14 diverse case studies, methods and tools that provide suggestions for interventions which directly or indirectly support the achievement of the UN SDGs.
Palpebral anthrax, a rare though important condition in villagers: A case report and review of literature;As an aerobic gram-positive rod, bacillus anthracis can cause potentially-lethal diseases in different organs. Localized eyelid inflammation is a rare presentation of cutaneous anthrax. The present case report involves two patients with palpebral anthrax admitted to the oculoplastic ward of Feiz Eye Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. The patients had a history of close contact with animals. Clinical presentation included palpebral swelling and necrosis of the eyelids in both cases. The patients first underwent an appropriate antibiotic regimen, and biopsy specimens were collected from their necrotic tissues. They were discharged after complete healing and followed up to manage possible complications. Cicatricial ectropion developed in both cases during their healing. A reconstructive surgery was also scheduled for both six months after their discharge.
Longitudinal profiling of the vaccination coverage in Brazil reveals a recent change in the patterns hallmarked by differential reduction across regions;Vaccination coverage is decreasing worldwide, favoring the potential reemergence of vaccine-preventable diseases. In this study, we performed a longitudinal characterization of vaccination coverage in Brazil and compared the profiles between the distinct regions in the country to test whether there has been a substantial change over the last 5 years.
Global Antimicrobial Stewardship with a Focus on Low- and Middle-Income Countries;Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health crisis. Antimicrobial Stewardship involves adopting systematic measures to optimize antimicrobial use, decrease unnecessary antimicrobial exposure and to decrease the emergence and spread of resistance. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face a disproportionate burden of antimicrobial resistance and also face challenges related to resource availability. Although challenges exist, the World Health Organization has created a practical toolkit for developing Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) that will be summarized in this article.
Safety and immunogenicity of a candidate Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus viral-vectored vaccine: a dose-escalation, open-label, non-randomised, uncontrolled, phase 1 trial;Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection continue to rise in the Arabian Peninsula 7 years after it was first described in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV poses a significant risk to public health security because of an absence of currently available effective countermeasures. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing the full-length spike surface glycoprotein, ChAdOx1 MERS, in humans.
Understanding Covid and the associated post-infectious hyper-inflammatory state (PIMS-TS) in children;When SARS-CoV2 infection was first reported from China, very few children had severe lung or systemic disease. Approximately six weeks after the first adult cases were reported in the United Kingdom, a small subgroup of children of largely non-white backgrounds, presented with severe hyper-inflammatory disease, most likely associated with Covid. The possible reasons for this ethnic predilection are explored.
STROBE-metagenomics: a STROBE extension statement to guide the reporting of metagenomics studies;The term metagenomics refers to the use of sequencing methods to simultaneously identify genomic material from all organisms present in a sample, with the advantage of greater taxonomic resolution than culture or other methods. Applications include pathogen detection and discovery, species characterisation, antimicrobial resistance detection, virulence profiling, and study of the microbiome and microecological factors affecting health. However, metagenomics involves complex and multistep processes and there are important technical and methodological challenges that require careful consideration to support valid inference. We co-ordinated a multidisciplinary, international expert group to establish reporting guidelines that address specimen processing, nucleic acid extraction, sequencing platforms, bioinformatics considerations, quality assurance, limits of detection, power and sample size, confirmatory testing, causality criteria, cost, and ethical issues. The guidance recognises that metagenomics research requires pragmatism and caution in interpretation, and that this field is rapidly evolving.
Sex and gender: modifiers of health, disease, and medicine;Clinicians can encounter sex and gender disparities in diagnostic and therapeutic responses. These disparities are noted in epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, disease progression, and response to treatment. This Review discusses the fundamental influences of sex and gender as modifiers of the major causes of death and morbidity. We articulate how the genetic, epigenetic, and hormonal influences of biological sex influence physiology and disease, and how the social constructs of gender affect the behaviour of the community, clinicians, and patients in the health-care system and interact with pathobiology. We aim to guide clinicians and researchers to consider sex and gender in their approach to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases as a necessary and fundamental step towards precision medicine, which will benefit men's and women's health.
The need for fully bio-based facemasks to counter coronavirus outbreaks: A perspective;The onset of coronavirus pandemic has sparked a shortage of facemasks in almost all nations. Without this personal protective equipment, healthcare providers, essential workers, and the general public are exposed to the risk of infection. In light of the aforementioned, it is critical to balance the supply and demand for masks. COVID-19 will also ensure that masks are always considered as an essential commodity in future pandemic preparedness. Moreover, billions of facemasks are produced from petrochemicals derived raw materials, which are non-degradable upon disposal after their single use, thus causing environmental pollution and damage. The sustainable way forward is to utilise raw materials that are side-stream products of local industries to develop facemasks having equal or better efficiency than the conventional ones. In this regard, wheat gluten biopolymer, which is a by-product or co-product of cereal industries, can be electrospun into nanofibre membranes and subsequently carbonised at over 700 °C to form a network structure, which can simultaneously act as the filter media and reinforcement for gluten-based masks. In parallel, the same gluten material can be processed into cohesive thin films using plasticiser and hot press. Additionally, lanosol, a naturally-occurring substance, imparts fire (V-0 rating in vertical burn test), and microbe resistance in gluten plastics. Thus, thin films of flexible gluten with very low amounts of lanosol (<10 wt%) can be bonded together with the carbonised mat and shaped by thermoforming to create the facemasks. The carbon mat acting as the filter can be attached to the masks through adapters that can also be made from injection moulded gluten. The creation of these masks could simultaneously be effective in reducing the transmittance of infectious diseases and pave the way for environmentally benign sustainable products.
Discovery and development of safe-in-man broad-spectrum antiviral agents;Viral diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Virus-specific vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most powerful tools to combat viral diseases. However, broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs, i.e. compounds targeting viruses belonging to two or more viral families) could provide additional protection of the general population from emerging and re-emerging viral diseases, reinforcing the arsenal of available antiviral options. Here, we review discovery and development of BSAAs and summarize the information on 120 safe-in-man agents in a freely accessible database (
Introduction to Modern Climate Change. Andrew E. Dessler: Cambridge University Press, 2011, 252 pp, ISBN-10: 0521173159;Climate change is the variability of the climate system that includes the atmosphere, the biogeochemical cycles (Carbon cycle, Nitrogen cycle and Hydrological cycle), the land surface, ice and the biotic and abiotic components of the planet earth. Significant impact of climate change is seen in the form of rise in temperature called as global warming. Carbon dioxide (CO
Continuous physiological monitoring using wearable technology to inform individual management of infectious diseases, public health and outbreak responses;Optimal management of infectious diseases is guided by up-to-date information at the individual and public health levels. For infections of global importance, including emerging pandemics such as COVID-19 or prevalent endemic diseases such as dengue, identifying patients at risk of severe disease and clinical deterioration can be challenging, considering that the majority present with a mild illness. In our article, we describe the use of wearable technology for continuous physiological monitoring in healthcare settings. Deployment of wearables in hospital settings for the management of infectious diseases, or in the community to support syndromic surveillance during outbreaks, could provide significant, cost-effective advantages and improve healthcare delivery. We highlight a range of promising technologies employed by wearable devices and discuss the technical and ethical issues relating to implementation in the clinic, focusing on low- and middle- income countries. Finally, we propose a set of essential criteria for the rollout of wearable technology for clinical use.
A cluster of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 caused by incubation period transmission in Wuxi, China;The infectivity and transmission capacity of COVID-2019 cases during the incubation period are not very clear. The manuscript described a cluster to provide information for research on incubation period infection.
;China has substantially increased financial investment and introduced favourable policies for strengthening its primary health care system with core responsibilities in preventing and managing chronic diseases such as hypertension and emerging infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, widespread gaps in the quality of primary health care still exist. In this Review, we aim to identify the causes for this poor quality, and provide policy recommendations. System challenges include: the suboptimal education and training of primary health-care practitioners, a fee-for-service payment system that incentivises testing and treatments over prevention, fragmentation of clinical care and public health service, and insufficient continuity of care throughout the entire health-care system. The following recommendations merit consideration: (1) enhancement of the quality of training for primary health-care physicians, (2) establishment of performance accountability to incentivise high-quality and high-value care
Middle East respiratory syndrome;The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lethal zoonotic pathogen that was first identified in humans in Saudi Arabia and Jordan in 2012. Intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters, and nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV continue to occur. Between April 2012 and December 2019, 2499 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 858 deaths (34·3% mortality) were reported from 27 countries to WHO, the majority of which were reported by Saudi Arabia (2106 cases, 780 deaths). Large outbreaks of human-to-human transmission have occurred, the largest in Riyadh and Jeddah in 2014 and in South Korea in 2015. MERS-CoV remains a high-threat pathogen identified by WHO as a priority pathogen because it causes severe disease that has a high mortality rate, epidemic potential, and no medical countermeasures. This Seminar provides an update on the current knowledge and perspectives on MERS epidemiology, virology, mode of transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical features, management, infection control, development of new therapeutics and vaccines, and highlights unanswered questions and priorities for research, improved management, and prevention.
Living with in-mask micro-climate;The in-mask micro-climate is heat and moisture buildup under facemasks but facemask doffing can immediately neutralize in-mask elevations in temperature and relative humidity. Therefore, home/workplace/facility living with in-mask micro-climate during COVID-19 pandemic warrants safe provisions for intermittent facemask “vacation”.
The war against the SARS-CoV2 infection: Is it better to fight or mitigate it?;In trying to understand the biochemical mechanism involved in the recent pandemic COVID-19, there is currently growing interest in angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Nevertheless, the attempts to counteract COVID-19 interference with this enzymatic cascade are frustrating, and the results have thus far been inconclusive.
Homeless persons with mental illness and COVID pandemic: Collective efforts from India;COVID-19 pandemic had made an unprecedented impact worldwide. India has entered into a total lockdown by invoking the special provision of Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2015. The complete lockdown policy has a direct and indirect impact on Homeless Persons with Mental Illness (HPMI) concerning shelter, basic needs and access to health care, besides the transmission of COVID infection. In this manuscript, we highlight the collective efforts undertaken by both the Government and Civil Society in providing care and protection to HPMI against COVID during the lockdown in India.

Monitoring disease transmissibility of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in Zhejiang, China;Owing to the frequent travel connections between Wuhan and Zhejiang, Zhejiang was the third worst-affected province in China with 1,205 cases confirmed before 26 February 2020. The transmissibility of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease was monitored in Zhejiang, accounting for the transmissions from imported cases. Even though Zhejiang was one of the worst-affected provinces, an interruption of disease transmission (i.e. instantaneous reproduction numbers <1) was observed in early/mid-February after a comprehensive set of interventions combating the outbreak.
Is it fair to hope that patients with Type 1 Diabetes (;The CoV-19 infection appears to be unusual among patients with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, although they are considered a fragile population. We think that this in part due to the peculiar immune condition that leads to the destruction of the Beta cells.
Changes in air quality related to the control of coronavirus in China: Implications for traffic and industrial emissions;Measures taken to control the disease (Covid-19) caused by the novel coronavirus dramatically reduced the number of vehicles on the road and diminished factory production. For this study, changes in the air quality index (AQI) and the concentrations of six air pollutants (PM
The effectiveness of quarantine and isolation determine the trend of the COVID-19 epidemics in the final phase of the current outbreak in China;Since January 23rd 2020, stringent measures for controlling the novel coronavirus epidemics have been gradually enforced and strengthened in mainland China. The detection and diagnosis have been improved as well. However, the daily reported cases staying in a high level make the epidemics trend prediction difficult.
“Therapeutic” facemasks;There must be pathophysiological reason why “cold” viruses like SARS-CoV-2 show proclivity to nasal cavity, oral cavity, pharyngeal cavity and upper airways which have lower temperature than core body temperature. Henceforth, facemasks’ “therapeutic” role against SARS-CoV-2 must be explored because personal “therapeutic” environments may get created under facemasks due to rebreathing of ~95°F “hot” and ~80% “humid” exhalations which may constantly mitigate SARS-CoV-2 inside nasal cavity, oral cavity, pharyngeal cavity and upper airways.
Environmental and nutritional impacts of dietary changes in Spain during the COVID-19 lockdown;The COVID lockdown has affected food purchases and eating habits. In this regard, this short communication assesses the nutritional and environmental impacts of these changes during the COVID lockdown in Spain, by applying Life Cycle Assessment and an energy- and nutrient-corrected functional unit. Three environmental impacts were studied (Global Warming Potential, Blue Water Footprint and Land Use) and a total of seven weekly diet scenarios were designed: two pre-COVID diets for March and April in 2019 (MAR19, APR19), one COVID diet (COVID) and two alternative diets, one based on the National Dietary Guidelines (NDG) and another one on the Planetary Health Diet (PHD). Results show that the COVID diet had larger energy intake and lower nutritional quality, as well as higher environmental impacts (between 30 and 36%) than the pre-COVID eating patterns. Further research is needed to account for food affordability within this assessment, as well as to analyze how eating patterns will evolve after the COVID lockdown. Finally, the definition of short guidelines for sustainable food behaviors for future possible lockdowns is suggested, as well as the introduction of sustainable indicators within NDGs.
Imprints of pandemic lockdown on subsurface water quality in the coastal industrial city of Tuticorin, South India: A revival perspective;Globally, the incidences of environmental improvements owing to seizing the anthropogenic activities during the lockdown have been reported through news articles and photographs, yet a formal scholarly study has been lacking to substantiate the imprints of lockdown. We hereby present the imprints of lockdown on water quality (both chemical and biological) parameters during the nationwide lockdown (COVID-19 epidemic) in India between 25th March to 30th May 2020. The present study describes the changes in chemical and biological water quality parameters based on twenty-two groundwater samples from the coastal industrial city of Tuticorin in Southern India, taken before (10 and 11th February 2020) and during the lockdown (19 and 20th April 2020) periods. The physico-chemical parameters compared are pH, total dissolved solids (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC), nitrate (NO
Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study;In December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.
2019-novel Coronavirus severe adult respiratory distress syndrome in two cases in Italy: An uncommon radiological presentation;Several recent case reports have described common early chest imaging findings of lung pathology caused by 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS-COV2) which appear to be similar to those seen previously in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected patients.
Reverse logistics network design for medical waste management in the epidemic outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19);The recent pandemic triggered by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus boosted the demand for medical services and protective equipment, causing the generation rate of infectious medical waste (IMW) to increase rapidly. Designing an efficient and reliable IMW reverse logistics network in this situation can help to control the spread of the virus. Studies on this issue are limited, and minimization of costs and the risks associated with the operations of this network consisting of different types of medical waste generation centers (MWGC) are rarely considered. In this research, a linear programming model with three objective functions is developed to minimize the total costs, the risk associated with the transportation and treatment of IMW, and the maximum amount of uncollected waste in MWGCs. Also, multiple functions that calculate the amount of generated waste according to the parameters of the current epidemic outbreak are proposed. Revised Multi-Choice Goal Programming method is employed to solve the multi-objective model, and a real case study from Iran is examined to illustrate the validation of the proposed model. The final results show that the model can create a balance between three considered objectives by determining the flow between centers, deciding to install two new temporary treatment centers, and allowing the network to only have uncollected waste in the first two periods in some MWGCs. Also, managerial insights for health organization authorities extracted from the final results and sensitivity analyses are presented for adequately handling the IMW network.
Coronavirus outbreak in Nigeria: Burden and socio-medical response during the first 100 days;The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic shocked the world, overwhelming the health systems of even high-income countries. Predictably, the situation has elicited social and medical responses from the public and governments, respectively. Nigeria recorded an imported case from Italy on February 27, 2020. Hence, this paper assesses the early socio-medical response to COVID-19 in Nigeria in the first 100 days after the index case. The paper employs analytical methods and collates data from various media reports and official sources.
Fenofibrate increases the amount of sulfatide which seems beneficial against Covid-19;Fenofibrate, which is a PPAR-alfpha agonist, increases the level of sulfatide. In this letter we hypothesize on the background of various findings that this is beneficial against COVID-19. Fenofibrate has been used for decades against hypercholesterolemia and has no serious side effects. Therefore, a trial giving fenofibrate to patients with corona virus infection is recommended.
The old but new: Can unfractioned heparin and low molecular weight heparins inhibit proteolytic activation and cellular internalization of SARS-CoV2 by inhibition of host cell proteases?;Currently, our world is facing the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and tremendous efforts are made for developing drugs to treat and vaccines to prevent the disease. At present, there is no specific antiviral drug or vaccine for COVID-19. The pathogenic infectivity of the virus requires the S1 subunit of the spike (S) protein to bind the host cell receptor, angiontensin converting enzyme (ACE2). While the binding to host cell receptor is the first step of infection, the entrance of the virus into the cell needs the cleavage of S1–S2 subunits to expose S2 for fusion to cell membrane via host proteases including cathepsins, cell surface transmembrane protease/serine (TMPRSS) proteases, furin, trypsin and factor Xa. Previous in vitro studies have shown that factor Xa inhibition can decrease viral infectivity. We suppose that host cell proteases including furin (as expressed highly in lungs), factor Xa and cathepsin are possible targets to decrease viral burden, therefore unfractioned heparin and low molecular weight heparin-LMWH (specifically dalteparin and tinzaparin for their anti inflammatory action) can be potential inhibitors of multiple endoproteases involved in virus infectivity. Our hypothesis needs to be tested in in vitro and clinical studies, however as we are in an urgent situation as the burden of SARS-CoV2 is increasing all around the world, we recommend the usage of unfractioned heparin or LMWH in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU hospitalized patients with the risk–benefit judgement of the clinician. Whether our hypothesis is clinically applicable and successful in decreasing viral infection will be evaluated for further studies.
Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China;A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.
Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding;In late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China. A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.
COVID-19 pandemic persuaded lockdown effects on environment over stone quarrying and crushing areas;Stone quarrying and crushing spits huge stone dust to the environment and causes threats to ecosystem components as well as human health. Imposing emergency lockdown to stop infection of COVID 19 virus on 24.03.2020 in India has created economic crisis but it has facilitated environment to restore its quality. Global scale study has already proved the qualitative improvement of air quality but its possible impact at regional level is not investigated yet. Middle catchment of Dwarka river basin of Eastern India is well known for stone quarrying and crushing and therefore the region is highly polluted. The present study has attempted to explore the impact of forced lockdown on environmental components like Particulate matter (PM) 10, Land surface temperature (LST), river water quality, noise using image and field derived data in pre and during lockdown periods. Result clearly exhibits that Maximum PM

COVID-19: Electrophysiological mechanisms underlying sudden cardiac death during exercise with facemasks;The mandatory use of facemasks is a public health measure implemented by various countries in response to the novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, there have been case reports of sudden cardiac death (SCD) with the wearing of facemasks during exercise. In this paper, we hypothesize that exercise with facemasks may increase the risk of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) leading to SCD via the development of acute and/or intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia. We discuss the potential underlying mechanisms including increases in adrenergic stimulation and oxidative stress leading to electrophysiological abnormalities that promote arrhythmias via non-reentrant and reentrant mechanisms. Given the interplay of multiple variables contributing to the increased arrhythmic risk, we advise avoidance of a facemask during high intensity exercise, or if wearing of a mask is mandatory, exercise intensity should remain low to avoid precipitation of lethal arrhythmias. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of an arrhythmic substrate even with low intensity exercise especially in those with established chronic cardiovascular disease in whom baseline electrophysiological abnormalities may be found.

Long-range air pollution transport in East Asia during the first week of the COVID-19 lockdown in China;Long-range transport (LRT) of air pollutants from East Asia during the northeast monsoon season impacts several downwind locations. In 2020, the initial COVID-19 lockdowns in China overlapped with Week 3 of the Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday, and an Asian outflow event. Thus, movement of the Chinese populace from city to city was already greatly reduced by the time of the LRT episode, although the reductions in industrial output are less clear. We found NO
;China empowers mobile health technologies to fight against COVID-19 pandemic. The success of mobile health here may be a useful reference for other parts of the world. We explore China's application of mobile health technologies to replenishing traditional public-health and social approaches for mitigating and suppressing COVID-19, and found that Internet hospitals alleviate the unavailability, inaccessibility, and inequity of health services during the outbreak
Arbidol combined with LPV/r versus LPV/r alone against Corona Virus Disease 2019: A retrospective cohort study;Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. We aimed to compare arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r) treatment for patients with COVID-19 with LPV/r only.
May patients receiving 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors be in higher risk of COVID-19 complications?;COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge for global and national healthcare providers. Number of new cases is continuously increasing with an emerging trend showing worse prognosis in males in comparison to females. Based on this observation, our proposed hypothesis is that 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, that are commonly used for BPH treatment, may be one of the factors contributing to poorer prognosis in males.
Characteristics of respiratory virus infection during the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus in Beijing;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading. Here, we summarized the composition of pathogens in fever clinic patients and analyzed the characteristics of different respiratory viral infections.
Comorbidities and the risk of severe or fatal outcomes associated with coronavirus disease 2019: A systematic review and meta-analysis;Existing findings regarding the relationship between comorbidities and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are inconsistent and insufficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between different comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19.
Effective Reproductive Number estimation for initial stage of COVID-19 pandemic in Latin American Countries;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become pandemic and turn in a challenge for Latin America. Understanding the dynamics of the epidemic is essential for decision making, and to reduce the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic. The present study aimed to estimate the effective reproductive number (R
Estimation of the reproductive number of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and the probable outbreak size on the Diamond Princess cruise ship: A data-driven analysis;Up to February 16, 2020, 355 cases have been confirmed as having COVID-19 infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. It is of crucial importance to estimate the reproductive number (R0) of the novel virus in the early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship.
COVID-19 and religious congregations: Implications for spread of novel pathogens;The COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the world. A principal preventive strategy is practicing social distancing. Congregations of the faithful at the local and transnational levels are strongly recommended by several world religions and religious orders, however, a gathering of large numbers of people in close approximation could be fertile ground for the spread of novel pathogens. The refusal to suspend such gatherings could lead to potential widespread dispersal of infections.
Estimating excess 1-year mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic according to underlying conditions and age: a population-based cohort study;The medical, societal, and economic impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has unknown effects on overall population mortality. Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom thus far have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high-risk conditions or their longer-term baseline (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence scenarios based on varying levels of transmission suppression and differing mortality impacts based on different relative risks for the disease.
Can charcoal improve outcomes in COVID-19 infections?;COVID-19 infection causes considerable morbidity and mortality, especially to those who are aged, have impaired renal function and are obese. We propose to examine the potential utility of oral activated charcoal with the hypothesis that such treatment would lower absorption of microbiome derived toxins and ameliorate systemic oxidant stress and inflammation.
Effect of temperature on the infectivity of COVID-19;To evaluate the influence of temperature on the infectivity of COVID-19 in Japan.
Evidence that high temperatures and intermediate relative humidity might favor the spread of COVID-19 in tropical climate: A case study for the most affected Brazilian cities;This study aimed to analyze how meteorological conditions such as temperature, humidity and rainfall can affect the spread of COVID-19 in five Brazilian (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Manaus and Fortaleza) cities. The cities selected were those with the largest number of confirmed cases considering data of April 13. Variables such as number of cumulative cases, new daily cases and contamination rate were employed for this study. Our results showed that higher mean temperatures and average relative humidity favored the COVID-19 transmission, differently from reports from coldest countries or periods of time under cool temperatures. Thus, considering the results obtained, intersectoral policies and actions are necessary, mainly in cities where the contamination rate is increasing rapidly. Thus, prevention and protection measures should be adopted in these cities aiming to reduce transmission and the possible collapse of the health system.
The use of ibuprofen to treat fever in COVID-19: A possible indirect association with worse outcome?;Fever has been reported as a common symptom occurring in COVID-19 illness. Over the counter antipyretics such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen are often taken by individuals to reduce the discomfort of fever. Recently, the safety of ibuprofen in COVID-19 patients has been questioned due to anecdotal reports of worsening symptoms in previously healthy young adults. Studies show that ibuprofen demonstrates superior efficacy in fever reduction compared to acetaminophen. As fever may have benefit in shortening the duration of viral illness, it is plausible to hypothesize that the antipyretic efficacy of ibuprofen may be hindering the benefits of a fever response when taken during the early stages of COVID-19 illness.
Viruses in wastewater: occurrence, abundance and detection methods;This paper presents an updated and comprehensive review on the different methods used for detection and quantification of viruses in wastewater treatment systems. The analysis of viability of viruses in wastewater and sludge is another thrust of this review.
Health security capacities in the context of COVID-19 outbreak: an analysis of International Health Regulations annual report data from 182 countries;Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks, as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events.
Coronavirus lockdown helped the environment to bounce back;As the transmission of novel corona virus (COVID-19) increases rapidly, the whole world adopted the curfew/lockdown activity with restriction of human mobility. The imposition of quarantine stopped all the commercial activity that greatly affects the various important environmental parameters which directly connected to human health. As all the types of social, economic, industrial and urbanization activity suddenly shut off, nature takes the advantages and showed improvement in the quality of air, cleaner rivers, less noise pollution, undisturbed and calm wildlife. This research aims to discuss the COVID-19 effect on the global environment. The outcome of this research says that “
Viral exanthem with “Spins and needles sensation” on extremities of a COVID-19 patient: A self-reported case from an Indonesian medical frontliner;Cutaneous manifestation is a newly reported clinical manifestation of COVID-19 infection. The clinical description of cutaneous manifestation is still not fully described. Our patient, a medical person, had viral exanthem distributed in the extremities along with a “Spins and needles sensation,” which differs from a previously published paper on cutaneous manifestations. The differential diagnosis of drug-induced skin rash and hand-foot-mouth disease was ruled out based on the patient's previous history and course of the disease.
Use of hydroxychloroquine and interferon alpha-2b for the prophylaxis of COVID-19;The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 infection demands efforts to reduce spread. In order to eradicate an infectious disease, a method of prevention with low social cost is the most effective way. While we wait for new therapies and a vaccine, we are proposing a solution based on the existing knowledge in biomedical sciences. Here we propose to use low doses of hydroxychloroquine (50–100 mg daily orally) and intranasal interferon alpha-2b (IFN α-2b) spray (0.5 × 10
May COVID-19 outbreaks lead to a worsening of skin chronic inflammatory conditions?;The emergence of the novel beta Coronavirus has raised serious concerns due to the virus rapid dissemination worldwide. Many areas throughout the world are now experiencing the COVID 19 outbreaks with government and policy authorities taking many aggressive isolation or restriction measures, drastically reducing also patient’s visits and limiting only to the most urgent ones such as oncological visits or emergencies.
Reductions in traffic-related black carbon and ultrafine particle number concentrations in an urban neighborhood during the COVID-19 pandemic;We investigated changes in traffic-related air pollutant concentrations in an urban area during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted in a mixed commercial-residential neighborhood in Somerville (MA, USA), where traffic is the dominant source of air pollution. Measurements were made between March 27 and May 14, 2020, coinciding with a dramatic reduction in traffic (71% drop in car and 46% drop in truck traffic) due to business shutdowns and a statewide stay-at-home advisory. Indicators of fresh vehicular emissions (ultrafine particle number concentration [PNC] and black carbon [BC]) were measured with a mobile monitoring platform on an interstate highway and major and minor roadways. Our results show that depending on road class, median PNC and BC contributions from traffic were 60–68% and 22–46% lower, respectively, during the lockdown compared to pre-pandemic conditions, and corresponding reductions in total on-road concentrations were 45-69% and 22-56%, respectively. A higher BC: PNC concentration ratio was observed during the lockdown period likely indicative of the higher fraction of diesel vehicles in the fleet during the lockdown. Overall, the scale of reductions in ultrafine particle and BC concentrations was commensurate with the reductions in traffic. This natural experiment allowed us to quantify the direct impacts of reductions in traffic emissions on neighborhood-scale air quality, which are not captured by the regional regulatory-monitoring network. These results underscore the importance of measurements of appropriate proxies for traffic emissions at relevant spatial scales. Our results are useful for exposure analysis as well as city and regional planners evaluating mitigation strategies for traffic-related air pollution.
COVID-19 and surface water quality: Improved lake water quality during the lockdown;Human life comes to a standstill as many countries shut themselves off from the work due to the novel coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) that hit the world severely in the first quarter of 2020. All types of industries, vehicle movement, and people's activity suddenly halted, perhaps for the first time in modern history. For a long time, it has been stated in various literature that the increased industrialization and anthropogenic activities in the last two decades polluted the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Since the industries and people's activities have been shut off for a month or more in many parts of the world, it is expected to show some improvement in the prevailing conditions in the aforementioned spheres of environment. Here, with the help of remote sensing images, this work quantitatively demonstrated the improvement in surface water quality in terms of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Vembanad Lake, the longest freshwater lake in India. The SPM estimated based on established turbidity algorithm from Landsat-8 OLI images showed that the SPM concentration during the lockdown period decreased by 15.9% on average (range: −10.3% to 36.4%, up to 8 mg/l decrease) compared with the pre-lockdown period. Time series analysis of satellite image collections (April 2013 – April 2020) showed that the SPM quantified for April 2020 is the lowest for 11 out of 20 zones of the Vembanad lake. When compared with preceding years, the percentage decrease in SPM for April 2020 is up to 34% from the previous minima.
The effect of corticosteroid treatment on patients with coronavirus infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis;An outbreak of novel coronavirus in 2019 threatens the health of people, and there is no proven pharmacological treatment. Although corticosteroids were widely used during outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, their efficacy remainedhighly controversial. We aimed to further evaluate the influence of corticosteroids on patients with coronavirus infection.

The secondary data analysis was derived from surveillance data for Covid-19 from government authorities, including the Ministry of Health, the Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency, and the local government of Jakarta. Three statuses related to Covid-19 were examined in the study: incidence, death, and recovered. Meanwhile, sunlight exposure was presented as daily duration of it. Only the number of recovered patients correlated significantly with sunlight exposure (
Challenge and strategies of infection control in psychiatric hospitals during biological disasters—From SARS to COVID-19 in Taiwan;Psychiatric hospitals play an important role in supporting patients with mental illness to relieve symptoms and improve functioning in a physically and psychologically safe environment. However, these hospitals are also vulnerable to emerging infectious diseases. In early 2020, a psychiatric hospital and a psychiatric unit were reported to have nosocomial coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. A large number of patients and staff were severely impacted. This type of nosocomial infection threatens patient safety and quality of care.
First-wave COVID-19 transmissibility and severity in China outside Hubei after control measures, and second-wave scenario planning: a modelling impact assessment;As of March 18, 2020, 13 415 confirmed cases and 120 deaths related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, outside Hubei province—the epicentre of the outbreak—had been reported. Since late January, massive public health interventions have been implemented nationwide to contain the outbreak. We provide an impact assessment of the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 during the first wave in mainland Chinese locations outside Hubei.
To avoid the noncausal association between environmental factor and COVID-19 when using aggregated data: Simulation-based counterexamples for demonstration;In the infectious disease epidemiology, the association between an independent factor and disease incidence (or death) counts may fail to infer the association with disease transmission (or mortality risk). To explore the underlying role of environmental factors in the course of COVID-19 epidemic, the importance of following the epidemiological metric's definition and systematic analytical procedures are highlighted. Cautiousness needs to be taken when understanding the outcome association based on the aggregated data, and overinterpretation should be avoided. The existing analytical approaches to address the inferential failure mentioned in this study are also discussed.
Prediction of the COVID-19 spread in African countries and implications for prevention and control: A case study in South Africa, Egypt, Algeria, Nigeria, Senegal and Kenya;COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) is globally spreading and the international cooperation is urgently required in joint prevention and control of the epidemic. Using the Maximum-Hasting (MH) parameter estimation method and the modified Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) model, the spread of the epidemic under three intervention scenarios (suppression, mitigation, mildness) is simulated and predicted in South Africa, Egypt, and Algeria, where the epidemic situations are severe. The studies are also conducted in Nigeria, Senegal and Kenya, where the epidemic situations are growing rapidly and the socio-economic are relatively under-developed, resulting in more difficulties in preventing the epidemic. Results indicated that the epidemic can be basically controlled in late April with strict control of scenario one, manifested by the circumstance in the South Africa and Senegal. Under moderate control of scenario two, the number of infected people will increase by 1.43–1.55 times of that in scenario one, the date of the epidemic being controlled will be delayed by about 10 days, and Algeria, Nigeria, and Kenya are in accordance with this situation. In the third scenario of weak control, the epidemic will be controlled by late May, the total number of infected cases will double that in scenario two, and Egypt is in line with this prediction. In the end, a series of epidemic controlling methods are proposed, including patient quarantine, close contact tracing, population movement control, government intervention, city and county epidemic risk level classification, and medical cooperation and the Chinese assistance.
;In this paper, a physicist's approach is given to support the necessity to wear surgical masks during the COVID-19 pandemics
COVID-19 & Periodontitis: The cytokine connection;COVID-19 is now recognized as a pandemic throughout the world, leading to a scramble in order to gather knowledge as well as evidence regarding the ‘novel’ corona virus which causes this disease.
COVID-19 response in low- and middle-income countries: don’t overlook the role of mobile phone communication;Estimates of health capacities in the context of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic indicate that most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are not operationally ready to manage this health emergency. Motivated by worldwide successes in other infectious disease epidemics and our experience in sub-Saharan Africa, we support mobile phone communication to improve data collection and reporting, communication between healthcare workers, public health institutions and patients and implementation of disease tracking and subsequent risk-stratified isolation measures. Programmatic action is needed for centrally coordinated reporting and communication systems facilitating mobile phones in crisis management plans for addressing the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs. We summarize examples of worldwide mobile phone technology initiatives that enhanced patient care and public health outcome in previous epidemics and the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we provide an overview of baseline conditions, including transparency about privacy guarantees, necessary for the successful use of mobile phones in assisting in the fight against COVID-19 spread.
Effect of lockdown amid COVID-19 pandemic on air quality of the megacity Delhi, India;Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a nationwide lockdown is imposed in India initially for three weeks from 24th March to 14th April 2020 and extended up to 3rd May 2020. Due to the forced restrictions, pollution level in cities across the country drastically slowed down just within few days which magnetize discussions regarding lockdown to be the effectual alternative measures to be implemented for controlling air pollution. The present article eventually worked on this direction to look upon the air quality scenario amidst the lockdown period scientifically with special reference to the megacity Delhi. With the aid of air quality data of seven pollutant parameters (PM
Clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women suspected of coronavirus disease 2019;2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic. Under such circumstance pregnant women are also affected significantly.
Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in Daegu, South Korea;Two Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks simultaneously occurred at a church and a long-term care facility in Daegu, South Korea. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 and factors related to severe outcomes.
Preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against importations of COVID-19: a modelling study;The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has spread from China to 25 countries. Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19.
Levels and sources of hourly PM;To control the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, many anthropogenic activities were reduced and even closed on the national scale. To study the impact of this reduction and closing down, hourly concentrations of PM
Mental health problems faced by healthcare workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic–A review;The spread of novel corona virus (COVID-19) across the globe and the associated morbidity and mortality challenged the nations by several means. One such underrecognized and unaddressed area is the mental health issues medical staff develop during the pandemic.
Association between mobility patterns and COVID-19 transmission in the USA: a mathematical modelling study;Within 4 months of COVID-19 first being reported in the USA, it spread to every state and to more than 90% of all counties. During this period, the US COVID-19 response was highly decentralised, with stay-at-home directives issued by state and local officials, subject to varying levels of enforcement. The absence of a centralised policy and timeline combined with the complex dynamics of human mobility and the variable intensity of local outbreaks makes assessing the effect of large-scale social distancing on COVID-19 transmission in the USA a challenge.
Serology testing in the COVID-19 pandemic response;The collapse of global cooperation and a failure of international solidarity have led to many low-income and middle-income countries being denied access to molecular diagnostics in the COVID-19 pandemic response. Yet the scarcity of knowledge on the dynamics of the immune response to infection has led to hesitation on recommending the use of rapid immunodiagnostic tests, even though rapid serology tests are commercially available and scalable. On the basis of our knowledge and understanding of viral infectivity and host response, we urge countries without the capacity to do molecular testing at scale to research the use of serology tests to triage symptomatic patients in community settings, to test contacts of confirmed cases, and in situational analysis and surveillance. The WHO R&D Blue Print expert group identified eight priorities for research and development, of which the highest is to mobilise research on rapid point-of-care diagnostics for use at the community level. This research should inform control programmes of the required performance and utility of rapid serology tests, which, when applied specifically for appropriate public health measures to then be put in place, can make a huge difference.
β-Glucan extracts from the same edible shiitake mushroom ;Coronavirus pneumonia is accompanied by rapid virus replication, where a large number of inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine storm may lead to acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. The uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, is associated with ARDS. This constituted the first study to report on the variability in physicochemical properties of β-glucans extracts from the same edible mushroom 
;The emergence of mental health (MH) problems during a pandemic is extremely common, though difficult to address due to the complexities of pandemics and the scarcity of evidence about the epidemiology of pandemic-related MH problems and the potential interventions to tackle them. Little attention has been devoted so far to this topic from policymakers, stakeholders and researchers, resulting in a lack of replicable, scalable and applicable frameworks to help plan, develop and deliver MH care during pandemics. As a response, we have attempted to develop a conceptual framework (CF) that could guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of MH interventions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This CF was developed by early career psychiatrists from 16 countries that cover all the WHO regions. Their opinions were elicited via a semi-structured questionnaire. They were asked to provide their views about the current MH situation in their countries and to elaborate on existing 'myths' and misinformation. They were also asked to name the resources available and to propose solutions and approaches to provide accessible and affordable care. The CF was prepared based on the extant literature and the views discussed in this group
Early network properties of the COVID-19 pandemic – The Chinese scenario;To control epidemics, sites more affected by mortality should be identified.

Using observational data to quantify bias of traveller-derived COVID-19 prevalence estimates in Wuhan, China;The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has been estimated using imported case counts of international travellers, generally under the assumptions that all cases of the disease in travellers have been ascertained and that infection prevalence in travellers and residents is the same. However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak.
The impact of COVID-19 partial lockdown on the air quality of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;The first COVID-19 case in Brazil was confirmed on February 25, 2020. On March 16, the state's governor declared public health emergency in the city of Rio de Janeiro and partial lockdown measures came into force a week later. The main goal of this work is to discuss the impact of the measures on the air quality of the city by comparing the particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone concentrations determined during the partial lockdown with values obtained in the same period of 2019 and also with the weeks prior to the virus outbreak. Concentrations varied with substantial differences among pollutants and also among the three studied monitoring stations. CO levels showed the most significant reductions (30.3–48.5%) since they were related to light-duty vehicular emissions. NO
Influence of Chinese New Year overlapping COVID-19 lockdown on HONO sources in Shijiazhuang;Nitrous acid (HONO) is an important precursor of hydroxyl radical (OH) in the atmosphere. It is also toxic to human health. In this work, HONO concentrations were measured in Shijiazhuang using a Monitor for AeRosols and Gases in ambient Air (MARGA) from December 15, 2019 to March 15, 2020, which covered the heavy air pollution season, the Chinese New Year (CNY) vocation and the Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) lockdown period. During & after CNY overlapping COVID-19 lockdown, the air quality was significantly improved because of both the emission reduction and the increase in diffusion ability of air masses. The mean HONO concentration was 2.43 ± 1.08 ppbv before CNY, while it decreased to 1.53 ± 1.16 ppbv during CNY and 0.97 ± 0.76 ppbv after CNY. The lockdown during & after CNY reduced ~31% of ambient HONO along with ~62% of NO and ~36% of NO
Epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill adults with COVID-19 in New York City: a prospective cohort study;Over 40 000 patients with COVID-19 have been hospitalised in New York City (NY, USA) as of April 28, 2020. Data on the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this setting are needed.
Need for sustainable biobanking networks for COVID-19 and other diseases of epidemic potential;Outbreaks of infectious diseases are occurring with increasing frequency and unpredictability. The rapid development and deployment of diagnostics that can accurately and quickly identify pathogens as part of epidemic preparedness is needed now for the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO has developed a global research and innovation forum to facilitate, accelerate, and deepen research collaboration among countries and funders. Great progress has been made in the past decade, but access to specimens remains a major barrier for the development and evaluation of needed quality diagnostics. We present a sustainable model for a global network of country-owned biobanks with standardised methods for collection, characterisation, and archiving of specimens and pathogens to facilitate and accelerate diagnostics development and evaluation for COVID-19 and other diseases of epidemic potential. The biobanking network should be run on the guiding principles of transparency, equitable access, ethics, and respect for national laws that support country ownership and sustainability. Adapting the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits, sharing of specimens from national biobanks can be rewarded through mechanisms such as equitable access to diagnostics at negotiated prices. Such networks should be prepared for any pathogen of epidemic potential.
Comment to the paper “Assessing nitrogen dioxide (NO;In this paper we critically review the work “Assessing nitrogen dioxide (NO
Evidence from two cases of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2: Are 14 days of isolation sufficient?;Among 78 laboratory-confirmed cases, we found two asymptomatic infections. One patient was discharged within 14 days after treatment. Another patient was discharged 25 days after treatment, and his RT-PCR test was still positive on the 15th day. We found that there may be virus carriers in the asymptomatic population with an epidemiological contact history. After 14 days of isolation, those with asymptomatic infection may still carry the virus, which means a risk of transmission, presenting a new challenge for the management of home isolation.
Indirect effects of COVID-19 on the environment;This research aims to show the positive and negative indirect effects of COVID-19 on the environment, particularly in the most affected countries such as China, USA, Italy, and Spain. Our research shows that there is a significant association between contingency measures and improvement in air quality, clean beaches and environmental noise reduction. On the other hand, there are also negative secondary aspects such as the reduction in recycling and the increase in waste, further endangering the contamination of physical spaces (water and land), in addition to air. Global economic activity is expected to return in the coming months in most countries (even if slowly), so decreasing GHG concentrations during a short period is not a sustainable way to clean up our environment.
A conceptual model for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China with individual reaction and governmental action;The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, emerged in Wuhan, China in the end of 2019, has claimed more than 2600 lives as of 24 February 2020 and posed a huge threat to global public health. The Chinese government has implemented control measures including setting up special hospitals and travel restriction to mitigate the spread. We propose conceptual models for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan with the consideration of individual behavioural reaction and governmental actions, e.g., holiday extension, travel restriction, hospitalisation and quarantine. We employe the estimates of these two key components from the 1918 influenza pandemic in London, United Kingdom, incorporated zoonotic introductions and the emigration, and then compute future trends and the reporting ratio. The model is concise in structure, and it successfully captures the course of the COVID-19 outbreak, and thus sheds light on understanding the trends of the outbreak.
Can COVID-19 induce glioma tumorogenesis through binding cell receptors?;The outbreak of Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) represents a global threat to the public healthcare. The viral spike (S) glycoprotein is the key molecule for viral entry through interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor molecules present on the cell membranes. Moreover, it has been established that COVID-19 interacts and infects brain cells in humans via ACE2. Therefore in the light of these known facts we hypothesized that viral S protein molecule may bind to the other overexpressed receptor molecules in glioma cells and may play some role in glioma tumorogenesis. Thus we leverage docking analysis (HEX and Z-DOCK) between viral S protein and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptors (HGFR/c-MET) to investigate the oncogenic potential of COVID-19. Our findings suggested higher affinity of Viral S protein towards EGFR and VEGFR. Although, the data presented is preliminary and need to be validated further via molecular dynamics studies, however it paves platform to instigate further investigations on this aspect considering the aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic in oncogenic perspective.
Triple combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin in the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19: an open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial;Effective antiviral therapy is important for tackling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We assessed the efficacy and safety of combined interferon beta-1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin for treating patients with COVID-19.
Addressing psychosocial problems associated with the COVID-19 lockdown;The lockdown imposed by the governments of various countries to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with various psychosocial problems. The complications within the family and time management issues that can occur during this time period are explored. The stigma and anxiety associated with the coronavirus disease are also addressed. It is noted that the problems faced by vulnerable communities including individuals with substance use disorder (SUD) tend to be ignored. These crucial areas that psychologists and mental health professionals should consider before providing intervention are discussed.
A first case of meningitis/encephalitis associated with SARS-Coronavirus-2;Novel coronavirus (SARS-Coronavirus-2:SARS-CoV-2) which emerged in Wuhan, China, has spread to multiple countries rapidly. We report the first case of meningitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 who was brought in by ambulance due to a convulsion accompanied by unconsciousness. He had never been to any foreign countries. He felt generalized fatigue and fever (day 1). He saw doctors nearby twice (day 2 and 5) and was prescribed Laninamivir and antipyretic agents, His family visited his home and found that he was unconsciousness and lying on the floor in his vomit. He was immediately transported to this hospital by ambulance (day 9). Under emergency transport, he had transient generalized seizures that lasted about a minute. He had obvious neck stiffness. The specific SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in the nasopharyngeal swab but was detected in a CSF. Anti- HSV 1 and varicella-zoster IgM antibodies were not detected in serum samples. A brain MRI showed hyperintensity along the wall of right lateral ventricle and hyperintense signal changes in the right mesial temporal lobe and hippocampus, suggesting the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 meningitis. This case warns the physicians of patients who have CNS symptoms.
Translation of genomic epidemiology of infectious pathogens: Enhancing African genomics hubs for outbreaks;Deadly emerging infectious pathogens place unprecedented challenge on health systems and economies, especially across Africa where health care infrastructures are weak, and poverty rates remain high. Genomic technologies have been vital in enhancing the understanding and development of intervention approaches against these, such as Ebola, and recently the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
WHO statement – “Older people are at highest risk from COVID-19”: Should the hypothesis be corroborated or rejected?;Coronavirus COVID 19 has become a threat to mankind affecting millions of people worldwide. United States, Italy and Spain has the highest number of Coronavirus cases as of April 30, 2020. According to World Health Organization (WHO) statement – “Older people are at highest risk from COVID-19”. However, in contrast to the statement, some new studies and findings have come to light. And this has created confusion in our mind as to whether the hypothesis should be corroborated or rejected.
Impact of quarantine measures on chemical compositions of PM;The COVID-19 epidemic broke out in Wuhan, Hubei in December 2019 and in January 2020 and was later transmitted to the entire country. Quarantine measures during Chinese New Year effectively alleviated the spread of the epidemic, but they simultaneously resulted in a decline in anthropogenic emissions from industry, transportation, and import and export of goods. Herein, we present the major chemical composition of non-refractory PM
Does type of immunosupression influence the course of Covid-19 infection?;Coronavirus disease 19 (Covid-19) is a new emerging virus responsible for pandemic and death. High blood pressure, diabetes, obesity have been described as poor prognosis factors. Few data have been reported in patient with immunocompromised status (solid tumor, hematological malignancy, rheumatoid conditions or organ transplant). We evaluated the characteristics of patients, including the outcome, with immunodepression hospitalized in Besancon University hospital (East of France). We wanted to identify if a type of immunosupression influences the course of Covid-19. In a cohort of 80 patients with immunosupression (42 solid tumors, 20 hematological malignancy and 18 non neoplastic immunosupression), poor outcomes (Intensive care unit hospitalization and or deaths) was frequent (38%) and tended to be more frequent in patients with hematological malignancy.
Nonuniform impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on air quality over the United States;Most of the state governments in United States (U.S.) issued lockdown or business restrictions amid the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, which created a unique opportunity to evaluate the air quality response to reduced economic activities. Data acquired from 28 long-term air quality stations across the U.S. revealed widespread but nonuniform reductions of nitrogen dioxide (NO
COVID-19: beta-thalassemia subjects immunised?;The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a contagious acute respiratory infectious disease whose causative agent has been demonstrated to be a novel virus of the coronavirus family, SARSCoV-2. A recent PRE-print study has showed a heme attack on the 1-beta chain of hemoglobin by COVID19. Beta-thalassemia results of a default in the hemoglobin beta-chain synthesis. 1,5% global population are heterozygotes for this disease. In this study, by a multiple linear regression, we have analyzed the evolution of COVID-19 infection in three Italian regions (Puglia, Sardinia, Sicilia) with different beta-thalassemic prevalences, in order to search a link. The results have showed that betathalassemic heterozygote population prevalence is correlated to immunity against COVID-19, by a regression. This paper is only for academic discussion, the hypotheses and conclusions needs to be confirmed by further research.
Air quality changes during the COVID-19 lockdown over the Yangtze River Delta Region: An insight into the impact of human activity pattern changes on air pollution variation;The outbreak of COVID-19 has spreaded rapidly across the world. To control the rapid dispersion of the virus, China has imposed national lockdown policies to practise social distancing. This has led to reduced human activities and hence primary air pollutant emissions, which caused improvement of air quality as a side-product. To investigate the air quality changes during the COVID-19 lockdown over the YRD Region, we apply the WRF-CAMx modelling system together with monitoring data to investigate the impact of human activity pattern changes on air quality. Results show that human activities were lowered significantly during the period: industrial operations, VKT, constructions in operation, etc. were significantly reduced, leading to lowered SO
Effect of the social distancing measures on the spread of COVID-19 in 10 highly infected countries;From the end of 2019, an unprecedented novel coronavirus, which was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) emerged from Wuhan city, China. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 has continued to rise, with over 4 million confirmed-cases and over 300,000 deaths worldwide until mid-May. This study aims to present the effect of the promulgation of social distancing measures on the spread of COVID-19 in the cases of 10 highly infected countries. The authors focus on the statistics of the COVID-19 confirmed-cases and deaths in 10 highly infected countries, including The U.S., Spain, Italy, The U.K., France, Germany, Russia, Turkey, Iran and China, and the response to the pandemic of these countries in the period from January 11 to May 2, 2020. The relationships between the social distancing measures and the statistics of COVID-19 confirmed-cases and deaths were analyzed in order to elucidate the effectiveness of the social distancing measures on the spread of COVID-19 in 10 highly infected countries. The results showed it took1–4 weeks since the highest level of social distancing measures promulgation until the daily confirmed-cases and deaths showed signs of decreasing. The effectiveness of the social distancing measures on the spread of COVID-19 was different between the 10 focused countries. This variation is due to the difference in the levels of promulgated social distancing measures, as well as the difference in the COVID-19 spread situation at the time of promulgation between the countries.
Pandemics and psychiatry: Repositioning research in context of COVID-19;The current Covid-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented threat to global well-being and its mental health consequences are just becoming understood. While the crisis has led to a temporary halt in a lot of ongoing or planned psychiatric research, this pandemic is a natural experiment that can help the field to repurpose research to better understand the causes, presentations and outcome trajectories as well as treatments in psychiatry. Inter-disciplinary collaborations between researchers are needed to rapidly develop and share the emerging new knowledge of the mental health implications of Covid-19, This will help mount an effective response to the current as well as future pandemics.
Early forecasting of the potential risk zones of COVID-19 in China's megacities;Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide public health threat. Early and quick identification of the potential risk zones of COVID-19 infection is increasingly vital for the megacities implementing targeted infection prevention and control measures. In this study, the communities with confirmed cases during January 21–February 27 were collected and considered as the specific epidemic data for Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. We evaluated the spatiotemporal variations of the epidemics before utilizing the ecological niche models (ENM) to assemble the epidemic data and nine socioeconomic variables for identifying the potential risk zones of this infection in these megacities. Three megacities were differentiated by the spatial patterns and quantities of infected communities, average cases per community, the percentages of imported cases, as well as the potential risks, although their COVID-19 infection situations have been preliminarily contained to date. With higher risks that were predominated by various influencing factors in each megacity, the potential risk zones coverd about 75% to 100% of currently infected communities. Our results demonstrate that the ENM method was capable of being employed as an early forecasting tool for identifying the potential COVID-19 infection risk zones on a fine scale. We suggest that local hygienic authorities should keep their eyes on the epidemic in each megacity for sufficiently implementing and adjusting their interventions in the zones with more residents or probably crowded places. This study would provide useful clues for relevant hygienic departments making quick responses to increasingly severe epidemics in similar megacities in the world.
Clinical and epidemiological features of 36 children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Zhejiang, China: an observational cohort study;Since December, 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally. Little is known about the epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients with COVID-19.
Impact of weather on COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey;The coronavirus pandemic, which has numerous global implications, has led people to believe that nothing will be the same as before. The present day is dominated by studies on determining the factors that affect, taking preventive actions, and trying to find an effective treatment on top priority. Meteorological parameters are among the crucial factors affecting infectious diseases. The present study examines the correlation between weather and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by considering nine cities in Turkey. In this regard, temperature (°C), dew point (°C), humidity (%), and wind speed (mph) are considered as parameters of weather. Research states that the incubation period of COVID-19 varies from 1 day to 14 days. Therefore, the effects of each parameter within 1, 3, 7, and 14 days are examined. In addition, the population is included as an effective parameter for evaluation. The analyses are conducted based on Spearman's correlation coefficients. The results showed that the highest correlations were observed for population, wind speed 14 days ago, and temperature on the day, respectively. The study results may guide authorities and decision-makers on taking specific measures for the cities.
COVID-19 spike-host cell receptor GRP78 binding site prediction;Understanding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) mode of host cell recognition may help to fight the disease and save lives. The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition.
;The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30 000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity
Psychological interventions during COVID-19: Challenges for low and middle income countries;At the start of 2020, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), originating from China has spread to the world. There have been increasing numbers of confirmed cases and deaths around the globe. The COVID-19 pandemic has paved the way for considerable psychological and psychosocial morbidity among the general public and health care providers. An array of guidelines has been put forward by multiple agencies for combating mental health challenges. This paper addresses some of the mental health challenges faced by low and middle income countries (LMIC). It is worthwhile to note that these are challenges at the current stage of the pandemic and may change with the course of the pandemic itself.
COVID-19 preventive measures showing an unintended decline in infectious diseases in Taiwan;Most of the communicable diseases have contact, airborne and/or droplet mode of transsmission. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, the Taiwan government implemented the use of masks and sanitizer, as well as other preventive measures like social distancing for prevention. This public response likely contributed significantly to the decline in the outbreak of other infectious diseases.
How did “flatten the curve” become “flatten the economy?” A perspective from the United States of America;The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic offers many medical, economic, societal, and cultural challenges. The response by individual states in the United States of America varies, but with the common initial impetus for all being to “flatten the curve,” which was intended to delay infections and spread the burden and impact on hospitals and medical systems. Starting with that intention, the responses by states has included many major steps not taken in prior pandemics. Those steps have significantly adversely affected hospitals rather than support them, and the overall impact has been to “flatten the economy” rather than just to “flatten the curve.” Many state governors have stated that their decisions are “science-led” and “data driven” but the reality is that there is not relevant experimental data. The progression of decisions during the early pandemic decisions is traced, and the basis of decisions based in science or herd mentality is discussed. Experiences are not experiments, and experiences are not founded in the scientific process. Medical and government leaders must be vigilant to recognize the limitations of available data in responding to unique circumstances.
Socioeconomic restrictions slowdown COVID-19 far more effectively than favorable weather-evidence from the satellite;We model the impact of restricting socioeconomic activities (SA) on the transmission of COVID-19 globally. Countries initiate public health measures to slow virus transmission, ranging from stringent quarantines including city lockdown to simpler social distancing recommendations. We use satellite readings of 
Aminoglycosides can be a better choice over macrolides in COVID-19 regimen: Plausible mechanism for repurposing strategy;In the current COVID-19 pandemic, prioritizing the immunity enhancers is equally important to anti-virals. Defensins are the forgotten molecules that enhance the innate immunity against various microbes. Although macrolides like azithromycin and clarithromycin etc., have been reported to act against respiratory infections but they lack the ability of immunity enhancement through defensins. The aminoglycosides were proved to have defensin mediated antiviral activity, that could enhance the immunity. So, Consideration of aminoglycosides can be a double edge sword 
COVID-19 lockdown effects on air quality by NO;During the months of March and April 2020 we witnessed the largest-scale experiment in history in terms of air quality in cities. Any prediction of this experiment's results may be obvious to science, as it was totally expected, the air quality has improved substantially. Simply stated, it comes as no surprise. The lockdown has made it possible to quantify the limit of decrease in pollution in light of this drastic reduction in traffic, in Madrid and Barcelona showed a significant decrease of the order of 75%. In the case of Spain's two largest cities, the reductions of NO
Applications of Google Search Trends for risk communication in infectious disease management: A case study of the COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan;An emerging outbreak of a novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has now been detected in at least 211 countries worldwide. Given this pandemic situation, robust risk communication is urgently needed, particularly in affected countries. Therefore, this study explored the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor public restlessness toward COVID-19 infection in Taiwan.
Critical review of social, environmental and health risk factors in the Mexican indigenous population and their capacity to respond to the COVID-19;The objective of this study was to conduct a critical analysis of the social, environmental and health risk factors in the Mexican indigenous population in the context of the COVID-19 disease pandemic, and to propose strategies to mitigate the impacts on these communities. Regarding social factors, we identified the return of indigenous people to their communities, poor access to water, language barriers, and limited access to the Internet, as factors that will not allow them to take the minimum preventive measures against the disease. Additionally, environmental risk factors associated with pollutants from biomass burning were identified. In health, the lack of coverage in these areas and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, respiratory tract infections, and chronic pulmonary diseases were identified. Some existing government programmes were identified that could be supported to address these social, environmental and health gaps. We believe that the best way to address these issues is to strengthen the health system with a community-based approach.
Applicability of the CURB-65 pneumonia severity score for outpatient treatment of COVID-19;The CURB-65 is a severity score to predict mortality secondary to community acquired pneumonia and is widely used to identify patients who can be managed as outpatients. However, whether CURB-65 can be applicable to COVID-19 patients for the decision of outpatient treatment is still unknown.

Association between ambient temperature and COVID-19 infection in 122 cities from China;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe public health problem globally. Both epidemiological and laboratory studies have shown that ambient temperature could affect the transmission and survival of coronaviruses. This study aimed to determine whether the temperature is an essential factor in the infection caused by this novel coronavirus.
;Based on data updated to May 20, 2020, in Italy the total recorded number of patients who died due to COVID-19-related reasons is 31,851. Demographic and clinical characteristics of died patients (including the number of comorbidities) are extremely relevant, especially to define those with a higher risk of mortality. Health authority recommends flu vaccination in a number of categories at risk of serious medical complications: subjects over 65, patients with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, COPD, renal failure, cancer, immunodeficiencies, chronic hepatopathies and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. The peak of the seasonal flu certainly preceded the pandemic one
Natural protection of ocular surface from viral infections – A hypothesis;A pandemic outbreak of a viral respiratory infection (COVID-19) caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) prompted a multitude of research focused on various aspects of this disease. One of the interesting aspects of the clinical manifestation of the infection is an accompanying ocular surface viral infection, viral conjunctivitis. Although occasional reports of viral conjunctivitis caused by this and the related SARS-CoV virus (causing the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s) are available, the prevalence of this complication among infected people appears low (~1%). This is surprising, considering the recent discovery of the presence of viral receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) in ocular surface tissue. The discrepancy between the theoretically expected high rate of concurrence of viral ocular surface inflammation and the observed relatively low occurrence can be explained by several factors. In this work, we discuss the significance of natural protective factors related to anatomical and physiological properties of the eyes and preventing the deposition of large number of virus-loaded particles on the ocular surface. Specifically, we advance the hypothesis that the standing potential of the eye plays an important role in repelling aerosol particles (microdroplets) from the surface of the eye and discuss factors associated with this hypothesis, possible ways to test it and its implications in terms of prevention of ocular infections.
COVID-19 and mental health: A review of the existing literature;The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis affecting several nations, with over 720,000 cases and 33,000 confirmed deaths reported to date. Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16–28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for more representative research from other affected countries, particularly in vulnerable populations.
Community quarantine strategy against coronavirus disease 2019 in Anhui: An evaluation based on trauma center patients;The objective of our study was to introduce community quarantine strategy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Anhui and evaluate the effectiveness of community quarantine based on trauma center (TC) patients.
Reductions in mortality resulting from reduced air pollution levels due to COVID-19 mitigation measures;To control the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, state and local governments in the United States have implemented several mitigation efforts that resulted in lower emissions of traffic-related air pollutants. This study examined the impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures on air pollution levels and the subsequent reductions in mortality for urban areas in 10 US states and the District of Columbia. We calculated changes in levels of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter no larger than 2.5 μm (PM
Monitoring transmissibility and mortality of COVID-19 in Europe;As a global pandemic is inevitable, real-time monitoring of transmission is vital for containing the spread of COVID-19. The main objective of this study was to report the real-time effective reproduction numbers (

Epidemic of COVID-19 in China and associated Psychological Problems;The world is experiencing pandemic of the COVID-19 now, a RNA virus that spread out from Wuhan, China. Two countries, China first and later Italy, have gone to full lock down due to rapid spread of this virus. Till to date, no epidemiological data on mental health problems due to outbreak of the COVID-19 and mass isolation were not available. To meet this need, the present study was undertaken to assess the mental health status of Chinese people. An online survey was conducted on a sample of 1074 Chinese people, majority of whom from Hubei province. Lack of adequate opportunities to conduct face to face interview, anxiety, depression, mental well-being and alcohol consumption behavior were assessed via self-reported measures. Results showed higher rate of anxiety, depression, hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and lower mental wellbeing than usual ratio. Results also revealed that young people aged 21–40 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use. To address mental health crisis during this epidemic, it is high time to implement multi-faceted approach (i.e. forming multidisciplinary mental health team, providing psychiatric treatments and other mental health services, utilizing online counseling platforms, rehabilitation program, ensuring certain care for vulnerable groups, etc.).
Estimation of COVID-19 prevalence in Italy, Spain, and France;At the end of December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan city, China. As of April 15, 2020, >1.9 million COVID-19 cases were confirmed worldwide, including >120,000 deaths. There is an urgent need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence to control this spread more effectively. Time series models are significant in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis. In this study, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 prevalence of Italy, Spain, and France, the most affected countries of Europe. The prevalence data of COVID-19 from 21 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 were collected from the World Health Organization website. Several ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters. ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) models with the lowest MAPE values (4.7520, 5.8486, and 5.6335) were selected as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19 in the future. The results of the analysis can shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak and give an idea of the epidemiological stage of these regions. Besides, the prediction of COVID-19 prevalence trends of Italy, Spain, and France can help take precautions and policy formulation for this epidemic in other countries.
The nexus between COVID-19, temperature and exchange rate in Wuhan city: New findings from partial and multiple wavelet coherence;This study attempts to document the nexus between weather, COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan and the Chinese economy. We used daily average temperature (hourly data), daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, and RMB (Chinese currency) exchange rate to represent the weather, COVID-19 outbreak and the Chinese economy, respectively. The methodology of Wavelet Transform Coherence (WTC), Partial Wavelet Coherence (PWC) and Multiple Wavelet Coherence (MWC) is employed to analyze the daily data collected from 21st January 2020 to 31st March 2020. The results have revealed a significant coherence between the series at different time-frequency combinations. The overall results suggest the insignificance of an increase in temperature to contain or slow down the new COVID-19 infections. The RMB exchange rate and the COVID-19 showed an out phase coherence at specific time-frequency spots suggesting a negative but limited impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan on the Chinese export economy. Our results are contrary to many earlier studies which suggest a significant role of temperature in slowing down the COVID-19 spread. These results can have important policy implications for the containment of COVID-19 spread and macro-economic management with respect to changes in the weather.
;Coronaviruses (CoV), discovered after 1960, caused human life-threatening outbreaks. SARS-CoV2, which appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019, causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and has different features than other coronaviruses, has been determined and the disease caused by the virus has been called “Coronavirus Disease-2019” (COVID-19). This disease activates both the natural and acquired immune system. The cytokin storm, in which blood levels of proinflammatory cytokines are detected excessively high is developing and the uncontrolled inflammatory response causes local and systemic tissue damages. Although a spesific drug has not been found yet, the medications currently in use for other indications, whose pharmacokinetic- pharmacodynamic properties and toxic doses are already known
;The majority of fatalities thus far in the COVID-19 pandemic have been attributed to pneumonia. As expected, the fatality rate reported in China is higher in people with chronic pulmonary disease (6.3%) and those who have cancer (5.6%). According to the American College of Cardiology Clinical Bulletin “COVID-19 Clinical Guidance for the CV Care Team”, there is a significantly higher fatality rate in people who are elderly (8.0% 70–79 years
Sampling and detection of corona viruses in air: A mini review;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a strain of coronaviruses that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In these days, the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through the air has become a controversial topic among scientists. Various organizations provide standard methods for monitoring biological agents in the air. Nevertheless, there has been no standard recommended method for sampling and determination of viruses in air. This manuscript aimed at reviewing published papers for sampling and detection of corona viruses, especially SARS-Cov-2 as a global health concern. It was found that SARS-Cov 2 was present in some air samples that were collected from patient's rooms in hospitals. This result warrants its airborne transmission potential. However, due to the fact that in the most reviewed studies, sampling was performed in the patient's room, it seems difficult to discriminate whether it is airborne or is transmitted through respiratory droplets. Moreover, some other disrupting factors such as patient distance from the sampler, using protective or oxygen masks by patients, patient activities, coughing and sneezing during sampling time, air movement, air conditioning, sampler type, sampling conditions, storage and transferring conditions, can affect the results. About the sampling methods, most of the used samplers such as PTFE filters, gelatin filers and cyclones showed suitable performance for trapping SARS-Co and MERS-Cov viruses followed by PCR analysis.
Pulmonary post-mortem findings in a series of COVID-19 cases from northern Italy: a two-centre descriptive study;COVID-19 is characterised by respiratory symptoms, which deteriorate into respiratory failure in a substantial proportion of cases, requiring intensive care in up to a third of patients admitted to hospital. Analysis of the pathological features in the lung tissues of patients who have died with COVID-19 could help us to understand the disease pathogenesis and clinical outcomes.
Survival of COVID-19 patients requires precise immune regulation: The hypothetical immunoprotective role of nicotinic agonists;Summary recent studies have provided novel evidence regarding the effect of nicotine agonists on the prevention or modulation of cytokines storm and reduction of infection. In this study we tried to attempt to address these issues from a therapeutic perspective of nicotine agonists in this manner and we describe one of the most challenging theories of immunotherapy in coronavirus-19 (COVID-19). The analysis of the proposed mechanism goes beyond the physiological consequences of a way to design new strategies to provide anti-inflammatory drugs.
Response of major air pollutants to COVID-19 lockdowns in China;COVID-19 suddenly struck Wuhan at the end of 2019 and soon spread to the whole country and the rest of world in 2020. To mitigate the pandemic, China authority has taken unprecedentedly strict measures across the country. That provides a precious window to study how the air quality response to quick decline of anthropogenic emissions in terms of national scale, which would be critical basis to make atmospheric governance policies in the future. In this work, we utilized observations from both remote sensing and in-situ measurements to investigate impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on different air pollutions in different regions of China. It is witnessed that the PM
The relationship between trends in COVID-19 prevalence and traffic levels in South Korea;The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic on March 12, 2020. Several studies have indicated that densely populated urban environments and the heavy dependence on traffic could increase the potential spread of COVID-19. This study investigated the association between changes in traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea.
Spatial epidemic dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China;On 31 December 2019 an outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, was reported. The outbreak spread rapidly to other Chinese cities and multiple countries. This study described the spatio-temporal pattern and measured the spatial association of the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China from 16 January–06 February 2020.
COVID-19 mortality in patients with cancer on chemotherapy or other anticancer treatments: a prospective cohort study;Individuals with cancer, particularly those who are receiving systemic anticancer treatments, have been postulated to be at increased risk of mortality from COVID-19. This conjecture has considerable effect on the treatment of patients with cancer and data from large, multicentre studies to support this assumption are scarce because of the contingencies of the pandemic. We aimed to describe the clinical and demographic characteristics and COVID-19 outcomes in patients with cancer.
Self-assessment of the Thai Department of Disease Control's communication for international response to COVID-19 in the early phase;This study aimed to assess the Thailand Department of Disease Control's (DDC) early responses to COVID-19 in respect to communication with the international community and to identify the manner of Thailand's response during public health emergencies.
Etoposide-based therapy for severe forms of COVID-19;The new coronavirus infection COVID-19 has quickly become a global health emergency. Mortality is principally due to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) which relays only on supportive treatment. Numerous pathological, clinical and laboratory findings rise the similarity between moderate to severe COVID-19 and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Etoposide-based protocol including dexametasone is the standard of care for secondary HLH. The protocol has been successfully used in HLHs that are secondary to EBV and H1N1 infections by inducing complete response and prolonged survival. These observations prompt to consider this cytotoxic therapy in HLH associated to moderately severe to severe forms of COVID-19.
Factors determining the diffusion of COVID-19 and suggested strategy to prevent future accelerated viral infectivity similar to COVID;This study has two goals. The 
Why all COVID-19 hospitals should have mental health professionals: The importance of mental health in a worldwide crisis!;COVID-19 pandemic has led to a worldwide crisis. At present, everyone is focusing on the prevention of COVID-19 infection, preparing and discussing issues related to physical health consequences. However, it is important to understand that the life-threatening negative physical health consequences are going to be faced by a few, but everyone is going to face the negative mental health consequences of the pandemic. At various places COVID-19 hospitals are being established, to address the physical health consequences of the pandemic. However, mental health professionals have not been very actively involved in the management of people going through this pandemic. This viewpoint discusses the mental health consequences of the pandemic for the health care workers, people who are undergoing quarantine, people who are admitted to the COVID-19 hospitals, and those who have recovered from the infection. The article also highlights the mental health needs of people at different levels and the kind of interventions, which may be carried out.

Early spring near-surface ozone in Europe during the COVID-19 shutdown: Meteorological effects outweigh emission changes;This paper analyses the impact of the control measures during the COVID-19 lockdown in Europe (15 March–30 April 2020) on 1-h daily maximum nitrogen dioxide (NO
Hospital suicide due to non-treatment by healthcare staff fearing COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh?;The COVID-19 pandemic has led to individuals fearing COVID-19 infection alongside conditions such anxiety, depression, trauma, and stress. For a small minority, such mental health factors can contribute to suicide. Here we report a novel reason for suicide and seemingly COVID-19-related – negligence in getting treatment by Bangladeshi healthcare providers. It was alleged that a woman committed suicide at a hospital because she was not treated and because doctors and nurses suspected she was infected with COVID-19 and did not want to get infected themselves. To help allay the fears among HCPs and the patients they are treating with COVID-19, a number of initiatives are suggested.
Could India be the origin of next COVID-19 like epidemic?;The COVID-19 global pandemic is not even over yet but it has already taught us a lot of lessons - the hard way. The vast majority of the global community has blamed the Chinese Illegal wildlife markets for the origin of this pandemic. Through careful scientific analysis, I have explained in this article that we don't need such wildlife markets for these kinds of outbreaks to occur in the future. I have also explained how India which is the second-most populous country in the world, could be the origin of the next outbreak, even though such wildlife markets are either very rare or do not exist at all in India.
Coupled human-environment system amid COVID-19 crisis: A conceptual model to understand the nexus;The world today is dealing with a havoc crisis due to the pervasive outbreak of COVID-19. As a preventive measure against the pandemic, government authorities worldwide have implemented and adopted strict policy interventions such as lockdown, social distancing, and quarantine, to curtail the disease transmission. Consequently, humans have been experiencing several ill impacts, while the natural environment has been reaping the benefits of the interventions. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the interlinked relationship between human society and the natural environment amid the current crisis. Herein, we performed a meta-analysis of existing literature reporting the various impacts of COVID-19 on human society and the natural environment. A conceptual model was developed to portray and address how the interaction of the existing elements of both sub-components of the coupled human-environment system (CHES) – human society and natural environment – are impacted by the government interventions. Results revealed a suite of positive and negative impacts of COVID-19 on both the sub-components. Our model provides an explicit impression of the complex nexus of CHES amid the current crisis. The proposed conceptual model could help in understanding the complex nexus by identifying the route of short-term impacts of COVID-19 measures and thus may aid in identifying priority areas for discussion and planning in similar other crises as well.
Preliminary estimation of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in Iran: A modelling analysis based on overseas cases and air travel data;As of March 1, 2020, Iran had reported 987 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases, including 54 associated deaths. At least six neighboring countries (Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Afghanistan, and Pakistan) had reported imported COVID-19 cases from Iran. In this study, air travel data and the numbers of cases from Iran imported into other Middle Eastern countries were used to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases in Iran. It was estimated that the total number of cases in Iran was 16 533 (95% confidence interval: 5925–35 538) by February 25, 2020, before the UAE and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries suspended inbound and outbound flights from Iran.
Modelling spatial variations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Africa;Clinical and epidemiological evidence has been advanced for human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus rampaging the world since late 2019. Outliers in the human-to-human transmission are yet to be explored. In this study, we examined the spatial density and leaned statistical credence to the global debate. We constructed spatial variations of clusters that examined the nexus between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases. We rely on publicly available data on confirmed cases and death across Africa to unravel the unobserved factors, that could be responsible for the spread of COVID-19. We relied on the dynamic system generalised method of moment estimation procedure and found a ~0.045 Covid19 deaths as a result of confirmed cases in Africa. We accounted for cross-sectional dependence and found a basis for the strict orthogonal relationship. Policy measures were discussed.
Modifiable areal unit problem and environmental factors of COVID-19 outbreak;Several recent studies have explored the association between environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and air pollution, and the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak by analyzing the statistical association at the district level. However, we argue that the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) arises when aggregating disease and environmental data into districts, leading to bias in such studies. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the association between environmental factors and the number of COVID-19 death cases under different aggregation strategies to illustrate the presence of MAUP. We used real-world COVID-19 outbreak data from the Hubei and Henan Provinces and studied their association with atmospheric NO
Correlation between weather and Covid-19 pandemic in Jakarta, Indonesia;This study aims to analyze the correlation between weather and covid-19 pandemic in Jakarta Indonesia. This study employed a secondary data analysis of surveillance data of covid-19 from the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia and weather from the Meteorological Department of the Republic of Indonesia. The components of weather include minimum temperature (°C), maximum temperature (°C), temperature average (°C), humidity (%), and amount of rainfall (mm). Spearman-rank correlation test was used for data analysis. Among the components of the weather, only temperature average (°C) was significantly correlated with covid-19 pandemic (
Impact of Covid-19 lockdown on PM;Covid-19 was first reported in Morocco on March 2, 2020. Since then, to prevent its propagation, the Moroccan government declared a state of health emergency. A set of rapid and strict countermeasures have taken, including locking down cities, limiting population's mobility and prohibiting almost all avoidable activities. In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the changes in levels of some air pollutants (mainly PM
Does COVID-19 cause permanent damage to olfactory and gustatory function?;The objective of this study was to investigate the status of COVID-19 patients with sudden anosmia and dysgeusia using an olfactory dysfunction questionnaire highlighting recovery times. This prospective study included 75 patients who completed a patient-reported outcome questionnaire. Among these, 46 patients completed an olfactory evaluation based on the duration of anosmia and dysgeusia. The olfactory evaluation revealed that 24% (N = 18) of patients had mild hyposmia, 13% (N = 10) had moderate hyposmia, 30% (N = 23) had severe hyposmia, 32% (N = 24) had anosmia, and 100% had dysgeusia (N = 75). The viral load significantly decreased throughout the 17 days following the onset of the olfactory disorder. The purpose of this study was to understand whether patients with COVID-19 can recover olfactory and gustatory function, in contrast to patients with other rhinoviruses and inflammatory diseases such as rhinosinusitis chronic and rhinosinusitis with polyps. These preliminary clinical findings indicate that the relatively rapid recovery of olfactory and gustative function can mean a resolution of viral infection in most patients. The present study suggests that coronavirus can induce olfactory dysfunction but not permanent damage. Olfactory and gustatory functional impairment has been recognized as a hallmark of COVID-19 and may be an important predictor of clinical outcome. Our study supports the need to add anosmia and dysgeusia to the list of symptoms used in screening tools for possible COVID-19 infection.
Correlation between climate indicators and COVID-19 pandemic in New York, USA;This study analyzed the association between COVID-19 and climate indicators in New York City, USA. We used secondary published data from New York city health services and National weather service, USA. The climate indicators included in the study are average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, rainfall, average humidity, wind speed, and air quality. Kendall and Spearman rank correlation tests were chosen for data analysis. We find that average temperature, minimum temperature, and air quality were significantly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of this study will help World Health Organization and health regulators such as Center for Disease Control (CDC) to combat COVID-19 in New York and the rest of the world.
Nurture to nature via COVID-19, a self-regenerating environmental strategy of environment in global context;Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has become the largest pandemic that has affected 210 countries. Rolling data indicate that 257,3605 people are infected by the disease, from which 701,838 have recovered and 178,562 have died. No specific medicine or vaccine is available yet to control the disease, hence, social distancing via lockdown is widely adopted as the only preventive measure. Social distancing is observed at different level of strictness in different counties but it almost made the world to stands still. Although scientific articles on this largest social move are scanty, it resulted in benefiting the deteriorated environment to revive back. Many environmental indices such as lowering NO
COVID-19: Healthy environmental impact for public safety and menaces oil market;COVID-19 seems as global emergency, by infectious virus, caused respiratory illness like having symptoms of flue, sickness, headache, and difficulty in breathing. Within months the world has been transformed into new order, thousands of people died and many more are fallen ill due to COVID-19 outbreak. China was the first country to see the outbreak and the first country to control it. However, the disease has broken out in Europe, the Middle East, the United States and other places. The United States has the highest number of cases in the world.
Lockdown, one, two, none, or smart. Modeling containing covid-19 infection. A conceptual model;A mathematical model has been created with the Systems Dynamics methodology. It is based on a SIR model, with the addition of auxiliary and state variables that represent hospital capacity, contacts, contacts with infected, deaths, giving, as a result, a model of four stock variables. Similarly, using piecewise functions, it was possible to model the “quarantines” or lockdowns, and the effectiveness of reduction in the contacts, Results show the decrease in infected people due to the quarantines. The model was simulated for a population of 100,000. The simulations show trends of infections that could occur in three different scenarios: A) one extended lockdown (60 days), B) two medium lockdowns of 30 days, with a 30-day smart lockdown space, and C) an initial 40-day lockdown and then a 30-day smart lockdown. All the lockdowns start on day 25 after the first reported infection. The model presents a compact structure of broad understanding and successful capture of a COVID-19 outbreak and therefore provides an overview to improve knowledge of outbreak trends and quarantine effectiveness in reducing infection.
COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil: Where are we at?;To analyze the trends of COVID-19 in Brazil in 2020 by Federal Units (FU).
COVID-19 outbreak reproduction number estimations and forecasting in Marche, Italy;COVID-19 disease is becoming a global pandemic and more than 200 countries were affected because of this disease. Italy is one of the countries is largely suffered with this virus outbreak, and about 180,000 cases (as of 20 April 2020) were registered which explains the large transmissibility and reproduction case numbers.
Burnout syndrome in Romanian medical residents in time of the COVID-19 pandemic;Burnout is a state of physical or mental collapse caused by overwork or stress. Burnout during residency training has gained significant attention secondary to concerns regarding job performance and patient care. The new COVID-19 pandemic has raised public health problems around the world and required a reorganization of health services. In this context, burnout syndrome and physical exhaustion have become even more pronounced. Resident doctors, and especially those in certain specialties, seem even more exposed due to the higher workload, prolonged exposure and first contact with patients. This article is a short review of the literature and a presentation of some considerations regarding the activity of the medical residents in a non-Covid emergency hospital in Romania, based on the responses obtained via a questionnaire. Burnout prevalence is not equal in different specialties. We studied its impact and imagine the potential steps that can be taken in order to reduce the increasing rate of burnout syndrome in the pandemics.
COVID-19's impact on the atmospheric environment in the Southeast Asia region;Since its first appearance in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019, the new coronavirus (COVID-19) has evolved a global pandemic within three months, with more than 4.3 million confirmed cases worldwide until mid-May 2020. As many countries around the world, Malaysia and other southeast Asian (SEA) countries have also enforced lockdown at different degrees to contain the spread of the disease, which has brought some positive effects on natural environment. Therefore, evaluating the reduction in anthropogenic emissions due to COVID-19 and the related governmental measures to restrict its expansion is crucial to assess its impacts on air pollution and economic growth. In this study, we used aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from Himawari-8 satellite, along with tropospheric NO
COVID-19 epidemic monitoring after non-pharmaceutical interventions: the use of time-varying reproduction number in a country with a large migrant population;COVID-19’s emergence carries with it many uncertainties and challenges, one of which is epidemic management strategies. Oman has implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. However, responses to NPIs may be different across different populations in a country with a large number of migrants like Oman. This study investigates the different responses to NPIs assessing the use of time-varying reproduction number (R
Estimating a breakpoint in the pattern of spread of COVID-19 in South Korea;Amid the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, South Korea has been lauded for successfully preventing the spread of this infectious disease, which may be due to the aggressive implementation of preventive policies. This study was performed to evaluate the pattern of spread of COVID-19 in South Korea considering the potential impact of policy interventions on transmission rates.
Sodium chromo-glycate and palmitoylethanolamide: A possible strategy to treat mast cell-induced lung inflammation in COVID-19;A novel human coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2 (also referred to as CoV-19) that emerged in late 2019 causes Covid-19 disease a respiratory tract infection which provokes about 4 million deaths per year. Unfortunately, to date, there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Mast cells (MCs) are immune cells implicated in the pathogenesis of viral infections, where they mediate inflammation. Microbes, including virus, activate MCs through TLR releasing chemical pro-inflammatory compounds and cytokines. Although, in biomedical literature there are only few reports on MCs activation by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by MC viral activation leads to increase pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Sodium Chromo-Glycate (SCG) described as a MC stabilizer, prevents the release of inflammatory chemical compounds, improve mouse survival and respiratory pathological changes in lung viral infection and suppresses inflammation. Furthermore, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) a nuclear factor agonist, an endogenous fatty acid amide, which exerts a variety of biological effects, related to chronic inflammation and pain, is involved also in MCs homeostasis with an inhibitory and protective effect on the respiratory tract during viral infections. Here, we hypothesize for the first time, that SCG and/or PEA suppress MC activation and pro-inflammatory mediators release, playing an anti-inflammatory therapeutic role in the inflamed lung of patients with COVID-19.
Safety and efficacy of anti-il6-receptor tocilizumab use in severe and critical patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019: A comparative analysis;As the novel SARS-CoV-2 pandemic occurred, no specific treatment was yet available. Inflammatory response secondary to viral infection might be the driver of severe diseases. We report the safety and efficacy (in terms of overall survival and hospital discharge) of the anti-IL6 tocilizumab (TCZ) in subjects with COVID-19.
The proportion of COVID-19 cases that are asymptomatic in South Korea: Comment on Nishiura et al.;The Korean Centers for Disease Control & Prevention reports the asymptomatic case proportion for COVID-19 is 33.3%. The asymptomatic case proportion in South Korea closely approximates the rate of 30.8% reported by Nishiura et al. (2020) among Japanese nationals returning from abroad.
N-acetycysteine: A potential therapeutic agent in COVID-19 infection;COVID-19 is an overwhelming pandemic which has shattered the whole world. Lung injury being the main clinical manifestation, it is likely to cause COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The possible cause behind this might be redox imbalance due to viral infection. Elevation in Glutathione (GSH) levels by administration of its promolecule might be effective. N-acetylcysteine is one such drug with potency to scavenge Reactive Oxygen Species, least side effects, and an effective precursor of glutathione. Consequently we hypothesize that N-acetylcysteine along with the conventional treatment may be treated as a potential therapeutic solution in cases of COVID-19 patients.
Impact of meteorological factors on the COVID-19 transmission: A multi-city study in China;The purpose of the present study is to explore the associations between novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case counts and meteorological factors in 30 provincial capital cities of China. We compiled a daily dataset including confirmed case counts, ambient temperature (AT), diurnal temperature range (DTR), absolute humidity (AH) and migration scale index (MSI) for each city during the period of January 20th to March 2nd, 2020. First, we explored the associations between COVID-19 confirmed case counts, meteorological factors, and MSI using non-linear regression. Then, we conducted a two-stage analysis for 17 cities with more than 50 confirmed cases. In the first stage, generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution were fitted to estimate city-specific effects of meteorological factors on confirmed case counts. In the second stage, the meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled effects. Our results showed that among 13 cities that have less than 50 confirmed cases, 9 cities locate in the Northern China with average AT below 0 °C, 12 cities had average AH below 4 g/m
COVID-19 and frequent use of hand sanitizers;Till date no medication or vaccine is available to cope with the COVID-19 infection and infection rate is increasing drastically across the globe. Only preventive measures and healthy life style with efficient immune system have been suggested by WHO to fight and stay safe from COVID-19. WHO recommended alcohol based hand sanitizers for frequent hand hygiene, which are mainly made up from ethanol, isopropyl alcohols, hydrogen peroxides in different combinations. These preparations may become toxic to human health and environment when misused. These chemicals have known toxic and hazardous impact on environment when released by evaporation. In early five months of 2020, American Association of Poison Control Center reported 9504 alcoholic hand sanitizer exposure cases in children under the age of 12 years and recognized that even a small amount of alcohol can cause alcohol poisoning in children that is responsible for confusion, vomiting and drowsiness, and in severe cases, respiratory arrest and death. Furthermore, frequent usage of said hand sanitizers has reported increased chance of antimicrobial resistance and chance of other viral diseases. Current review is designed with main objective to highlight the toxic and serious health risks to human health and environment by frequent using hand hygiene products with alcohols based formulations.
Distinctive trajectories of the COVID-19 epidemic by age and gender: A retrospective modeling of the epidemic in South Korea;Elderly people had suffered a disproportionate burden of COVID-19. We hypothesized that males and females in different age groups might have different epidemic trajectories.
Logistic growth modelling of COVID-19 proliferation in China and its international implications;As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to proliferate globally, this paper shares the findings of modelling the outbreak in China at both provincial and national levels. This paper examines the applicability of the logistic growth model, with implications for the study of the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious diseases.
Clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19):A multi-center study in Wenzhou city, Zhejiang, China;Little is known about COVID-19 outside Hubei. The aim of this paper was to describe the clinical characteristics and imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.
Three cases of treatment with nafamostat in elderly patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who need oxygen therapy;No effective treatment for COVID-19 has been well established yet. Nafamostat, known as anticoagulant, has potential anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities against COVID-19. We report three cases of COVID-19 pneumonia who progressed while using antiviral drugs and needed supplementary oxygen therapy, improved after treatment with nafamostat. These preliminary findings show the possibility that Nafamostat can be considered to be used in elderly patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who need oxygen therapy. The effectiveness of nafamostat should be evaluated in further studies.
Impacts of the COVID-19 responses on traffic-related air pollution in a Northwestern US city;This study evaluates the COVID-19 impacts on traffic-related air pollution, including ultrafine particles (UFPs), PM
Reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with severe COVID-19 disease by advancing ongoing trials of Mesenchymal Stromal (stem) Cell (MSC) therapy — Achieving global consensus and visibility for cellular host-directed therapies;As of May 17th 2020, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused 307,395 deaths worldwide, out of 3,917,366 cases reported to the World Health Organization. No specific treatments for reducing mortality or morbidity are yet available. Deaths from COVID-19 will continue to rise globally until effective and appropriate treatments and/or vaccines are found. In search of effective treatments, the global medical, scientific, pharma and funding communities have rapidly initiated over 500 COVID-19 clinical trials on a range of antiviral drug regimens and repurposed drugs in various combinations. A paradigm shift is underway from the current focus of drug development targeting the pathogen, to advancing cellular Host-Directed Therapies (HDTs) for tackling the aberrant host immune and inflammatory responses which underlie the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and high COVID-19 mortality rates. We focus this editorial specifically on the background to, and the rationale for, the use and evaluation of mesenchymal stromal (Stem) cells (MSCs) in treatment trials of patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Currently, the ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) report a combined 28 trials exploring the potential of MSCs or their products for treatment of COVID-19. MSCs should also be trialed for treatment of other circulating WHO priority Blueprint pathogens such as MERS-CoV which causes upto 34% mortality rates. It’s about time funding agencies invested more into development MSCs per se, and also for a range of other HDTs, in combination with other therapeutic interventions. MSC therapy could turn out to be an important contribution to bringing an end to the high COVID-19 death rates and preventing long-term functional disability in those who survive disease.
Performance of pneumonia severity index and CURB-65 in predicting 30-day mortality in patients with COVID-19;The aim of the study was to analyze the usefulness of CURB-65 and the pneumonia severity index (PSI) in predicting 30-day mortality in patients with COVID-19, and to identify other factors associated with higher mortality.
Pulmonary delivery of nanostructured lipid carriers for effective repurposing of salinomycin as an antiviral agent;Coronavirus disease outbreak caused a severe public health burden all over the world. Salinomycin (SAL) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that had drawn attention in selective targeting of cancer and viral infections. Recent drug screen identified SAL as a potent antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2. In this hypothesis, we discuss the potential of pulmonary delivery of SAL using nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) against SARS-CoV-2.
Inter nation social lockdown versus medical care against COVID-19, a mild environmental insight with special reference to India;Infection by coronavirus (CoV-19) has led to emergence of a pandemic called as Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) that has so far affected about 210 countries. The dynamic data indicate that the pandemic by CoV-19 so far has infected 2,403,963 individuals, and among these 624,698 have recovered while, it has been fatal for 165,229. Without much experience, currently, the medicines that are clinically being evaluated for COVID-19 include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab, lopinavir, ritonavir, tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Therefore, countries such as Italy, USA, Spain and France with the most advanced health care system are partially successful to control CoV-19 infection. India being the 2nd largest populous country, where, the healthcare system is underdeveloped, major portion of population follow unhygienic lifestyle, is able to restrict the rate of both infection and death of its citizens from COVID-19. India has followed an early and a very strict social distancing by lockdown and has issued advisory to clean hands regularly by soap and/or by alcohol based sterilizers. Rolling data on the global index of the CoV infection is 13,306, and the index of some countries such as USA (66,148), Italy (175,055), Spain (210,126), France (83,363) and Switzerland (262,122) is high. The index of India has remained very low (161) so far, mainly due to early implementation of social lockdown, social distancing, and sanitizing hands. However, articles on social lockdown as a preventive measure against COVID-19 in PubMed are scanty. It has been observed that social lockdown has also drastic impacts on the environment especially on reduction of NO
;Several risk factors are associated with a worse outcome for COVID-19 patients
COVID-19 challenges to Pakistan: Is GIS analysis useful to draw solutions?;The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a public health emergency that had caused disastrous results in more than 100 countries. The ability to detect disease outbreaks in the early stages is a key component of efficient disease control and prevention. With the increased availability of electronic health-care data and spatial analysis techniques, there is great potential to develop algorithms to enable more effective disease surveillance. The research focuses to develop a transparent user-friendly method to simulate the outbreak data. The paper describes the GIS tools to identify and define the field of investigation which requires consideration of the strengths and limitations of data collection instruments, facility of locational data collection, accuracy of locational data, and pertinent attributes for understanding disease risk. Using such information, it is quite easy for authorities to locate the highly effected area and take appropriate actions in that particular areas. However, GIS techniques, resources, and methods can be used in Pakistan for more effective investigation of vulnerable geographical locations.
Appropriate use of Tocilizumab in COVID-19 Infection;We aimed to describe the effectiveness and optimum use of tocilizumab (TCZ) treatment by the support of clinical, laboratory, and radiologic observations.
Air quality development during the COVID-19 pandemic over a medium-sized urban area in Thailand;The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an industrial and financial slowdown due to unprecedented regulations imposed with the purpose to contain the spread of the virus. Consequently, the positive effect on the environment has been witnessed. One of the most prominent evidences has been the drastic air quality improvement, as a direct consequence of lower emissions from reduced industrial activity. While several studies have demonstrated the validity of this hypothesis in mega-cities worldwide, it is still an unsubstantiated fact whether the same holds true for cities with a smaller urban extent and population. In the present study we investigate the temporal development of atmospheric constituent concentrations as retrieved concurrently from the Sentinel-5P satellite and a ground meteorological station. We focus on the period before and during the COVID-19 pandemic over the city of Hat Yai, Thailand and present the effect of the lockdown on the atmospheric quality over this average populated city (156,000 inhabitants). NO
A clinical risk score to identify patients with COVID-19 at high risk of critical care admission or death: An observational cohort study;The COVID-19 pandemic continues to escalate. There is urgent need to stratify patients. Understanding risk of deterioration will assist in admission and discharge decisions, and help selection for clinical studies to indicate where risk of therapy-related complications is justified.
Immunogenicity and safety of a recombinant adenovirus type-5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine in healthy adults aged 18 years or older: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial;This is the first randomised controlled trial for assessment of the immunogenicity and safety of a candidate non-replicating adenovirus type-5 (Ad5)-vectored COVID-19 vaccine, aiming to determine an appropriate dose of the candidate vaccine for an efficacy study.
COVID-19 pandemic: Impacts on the air quality during the partial lockdown in São Paulo state, Brazil;In early March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic, and in late March 2020 partial lockdown was ordered by the São Paulo state government. The aim of this study was to assess impacts on air quality in São Paulo – Brazil, during the partial lockdown implemented to provide social distancing required due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have analyzed data from four air quality stations in São Paulo, Brazil to assess air pollutant concentration variations during the partial lockdown. Data were compared to the five-year monthly mean and to the four-week before the partial lockdown. Overall, drastic reductions on NO (up to −77.3%), NO
;Number of cities worlwide experienced air quality improvements during COVID-19 lockdowns
GIS-based spatial modeling of COVID-19 incidence rate in the continental United States;During the first 90 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, over 675,000 confirmed cases of the disease have been reported, posing unprecedented socioeconomic burden to the country. Due to inadequate research on geographic modeling of COVID-19, we investigated county-level variations of disease incidence across the continental United States. We compiled a geodatabase of 35 environmental, socioeconomic, topographic, and demographic variables that could explain the spatial variability of disease incidence. Further, we employed spatial lag and spatial error models to investigate spatial dependence and geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale GWR (MGWR) models to locally examine spatial non-stationarity. The results suggested that even though incorporating spatial autocorrelation could significantly improve the performance of the global ordinary least square model, these models still represent a significantly poor performance compared to the local models. Moreover, MGWR could explain the highest variations (adj. R
COVID 19 pandemic: Mental health challenges of internal migrant workers of India;COVID- 19, a biomedical disease has serious physical and tremendous mental health implications as the rapidly spreading pandemic. One of the most vulnerable, but neglected, an occupational community of internal migrant workers is prone for development of psychological ill-effects due to double whammy impact of COVID-19 crisis and concomitant adverse occupational scenario.
Effect of weather on COVID-19 spread in the US: A prediction model for India in 2020;The effect of weather on COVID-19 spread is poorly understood. Recently, few studies have claimed that warm weather can possibly slowdown the global pandemic, which has already affected over 1.6 million people worldwide. Clarification of such relationships in the worst affected country, the US, can be immensely beneficial to understand the role of weather in transmission of the disease in the highly populated countries, such as India. We collected the daily data of new cases in 50 US states between Jan 1–Apr 9, 2020 and also the corresponding weather information (i.e., temperature (T) and absolute humidity (AH)). Distribution modeling of new cases across AH and T, helped identify the narrow and vulnerable AH range. We validated the results for 10-day intervals against monthly observations, and also worldwide trends. The results were used to predict Indian regions which would be vulnerable to weather based spread in upcoming months of 2020. COVID-19 spread in the US is significant for states with 4 < AH < 6 g/m
Navigating immunosuppression in a pandemic: A guide for the dermatologist from the COVID Task Force of the Medical Dermatology Society and Society of Dermatology Hospitalists;Dermatologists treating immune-mediated skin disease must now contend with the uncertainties associated with immunosuppressive use in the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Although the risk of infection with many commonly used immunosuppressive agents remains low, direct data evaluating the safety of such agents in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce. This article reviews and offers guidance based on currently available safety data and the most recent COVID-19 outcome data in patients with immune-mediated dermatologic disease. The interdisciplinary panel of experts emphasizes a stepwise, shared decision-making approach in the management of immunosuppressive therapy. The goal of this article is to help providers minimize the risk of disease flares while simultaneously minimizing the risk of iatrogenic harm during an evolving pandemic.
Epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in 391 cases and 1286 of their close contacts in Shenzhen, China: a retrospective cohort study;Rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen, China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures.
Lymphopenia is associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections: A systemic review and meta-analysis;Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new respiratory and systemic disease which needs quick identification of potential critical patients. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the relationship between lymphocyte count and the severity of COVID-19.
COVID-19 lockdown measures reveal human impact on water transparency in the Venice Lagoon;The lagoon of Venice has always been affected by the regional geomorphological evolution, anthropogenic stressors and global changes. Different morphological settings and variable biogeophysical conditions characterize this continuously evolving system that rapidly responds to the anthropic impacts. When the lockdown measures were enforced in Italy to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on March 10th 2020, the ordinary urban water traffic around Venice, one of the major pressures in the lagoon, came to a halt. This provided a unique opportunity to analyse the environmental effects of restrictions to mobility on water transparency. Pseudo true-colour composites Sentinel-2 satellite imagery proved useful for qualitative visual interpretation, showing the reduction of the vessel traffic and their wakes from the periods before and during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. A quantitative analysis of suspended matter patterns, based on satellite-derived turbidity, in the absence of traffic perturbations, allowed to focus on natural processes and the residual stress from human activities that continued throughout the lockdown. We conclude that the high water transparency can be considered as a transient condition determined by a combination of natural seasonal factors and the effects of COVID-19 restrictions.
Kawasaki-like disease in children with COVID-19: A hypothesis;With rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome- corona virus-2 (SARS-COV-2) globally, some new aspects of the disease have been reported. Recently, it has been reported the incidence of Kawasaki-like disease among children with COVID-19. Since, children had been known to be less severely affected by the virus in part due to the higher concentration of Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptor, this presentation has emerged concerns regarding the infection of children with SARS-COV2. ACE2 has anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anti-proliferative characteristics through converting angiotensin (Ag)-II to Ang (1–7). ACE2 receptor is downregulated by the SARS-COV through the spike protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-S) via a process that is tightly coupled with Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production. TNF-α plays a key role in aneurysmal formation of coronary arteries in Kawasaki disease (KD). Affected children by COVID-19 with genetically-susceptible to KD might have genetically under-expression of ACE2 receptor that might further decrease the expression of ACE2 due to the downregulation of the receptor by the virus in these patients. It appears that TNF- α might be the cause and the consequence of the ACE2 receptor downregulation which results in arterial walls aneurysm. Conclusion: Genetically under-expression of ACE2 receptor in children with genetically-susceptible to KD who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 possibly further downregulates the ACE2 expression by TNF-α and leads to surge of inflammation including TNF-α and progression to Kawasaki-like disease.
Factors associated with increased all-cause mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy;The number of excess deaths during February–March 2020 in Italy, in comparison with previous years, was considerably higher than the recorded COVID19-related deaths. The present study aimed to explore the association of excess mortality with some indices related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its management.
Possible mechanisms responsible for acute coronary events in COVID-19;The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is primarily a respiratory pathogen and its clinical manifestations are dominated by respiratory symptoms, the most severe of which is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, COVID-19 is increasingly recognized to cause an overwhelming inflammatory response and cytokine storm leading to end organ damage. End organ damage to heart is one of the most severe complications of COVID-19 that increases the risk of death. We proposed a two-fold mechanism responsible for causing acute coronary events in patients with COVID-19 infection: Cytokine storm leading to rapid onset formation of new coronary plaques along with destabilization of pre-existing plaques and direct myocardial injury secondary to acute systemic viral infection. A well-coordinated immune response is the first line innate immunity against a viral infection. However, an uncoordinated response and hypersecretion of cytokines and chemokines lead to immune related damage to the human body. Human Coronavirus (HCoV) infection causes infiltration of inflammatory cells that cause excessive production of cytokines, proteases, coagulation factors, oxygen radicals and vasoactive molecules causing endothelial damage, disruption of fibrous cap and initiation of formation of thrombus. Systemic viral infections also cause vasoconstriction leading to narrowing of vascular lumen and stimulation of platelet activation via shear stress. The resultant cytokine storm causes secretion of hypercoagulable tissue factor without consequential increase in counter-regulatory pathways such as AT-III, activated protein C and plasminogen activator type 1. Lastly, influx of CD4+ T-cells in cardiac vasculature results in an increased production of cytokines that stimulate smooth muscle cells to migrate into the intima and generate collagen and other fibrous products leading to advancement of fatty streaks to advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Direct myocardial damage and cytokine storm leading to destabilization of pre-existing plaques and accelerated formation of new plaques are the two instigating mechanisms for acute coronary syndromes in COVID-19.
Non-negligible impacts of clean air regulations on the reduction of tropospheric NO;We study the variation of tropospheric NO
Implications for air quality management of changes in air quality during lockdown in Auckland (New Zealand) in response to the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 epidemic;The current changes in vehicle movement due to ‘lockdown’ conditions (imposed in cities worldwide in response to the COVID-19 epidemic) provide opportunities to quantify the local impact of ‘controlled interventions’ on air quality and establish baseline pollution concentrations in cities. Here, we present a case study from Auckland, New Zealand, an isolated Southern Hemisphere city, which is largely unaffected by long-range pollution transport or industrial sources of air pollution. In this city, traffic flows reduced by 60–80% as a result of a government-led initiative to contain the virus by limiting all transport to only essential services. In this paper, ambient pollutant concentrations of NO
COVID-19 in health-care workers in three hospitals in the south of the Netherlands: a cross-sectional study;10 days after the first reported case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the Netherlands (on Feb 27, 2020), 55 (4%) of 1497 health-care workers in nine hospitals located in the south of the Netherlands had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We aimed to gain insight in possible sources of infection in health-care workers.
Individual quarantine versus active monitoring of contacts for the mitigation of COVID-19: a modelling study;Voluntary individual quarantine and voluntary active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies for emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Given the impact of quarantine on resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions individual quarantine can more effectively control COVID-19 than active monitoring. As an epidemic grows, it is also important to consider when these interventions are no longer feasible and broader mitigation measures must be implemented.
A minimal common outcome measure set for COVID-19 clinical research;Clinical research is necessary for an effective response to an emerging infectious disease outbreak. However, research efforts are often hastily organised and done using various research tools, with the result that pooling data across studies is challenging. In response to the needs of the rapidly evolving COVID-19 outbreak, the Clinical Characterisation and Management Working Group of the WHO Research and Development Blueprint programme, the International Forum for Acute Care Trialists, and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium have developed a minimum set of common outcome measures for studies of COVID-19. This set includes three elements: a measure of viral burden (quantitative PCR or cycle threshold), a measure of patient survival (mortality at hospital discharge or at 60 days), and a measure of patient progression through the health-care system by use of the WHO Clinical Progression Scale, which reflects patient trajectory and resource use over the course of clinical illness. We urge investigators to include these key data elements in ongoing and future studies to expedite the pooling of data during this immediate threat, and to hone a tool for future needs.
A new approach for COVID-19 treatment by micro-RNA;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) naturally occur in plants and all living organisms. They play an important role in gene regulation through binding toa specific region in open reading frames (ORFs) and/or untranslated regions (UTRs) to block the translation processes through either degrading or blocking mRNA resulting in knocking down or suppression of targeted genes. Plants and many organisms protect themselves from viruses through the production of miRNAs, which are complementary to 3UTR of viruses resulting in degrading the viral mRNA or block the translation on ribosomes. As pandemic, COVID-19, and its consequences on the global economy, we hypothesized a new approach for the treatment of COVID-19 paints. This approach includes designing a mix of miRNAs targeting several regions on COVID-19 open reading frame (ORF) and 3 UTR and suitable delivery system targeting respiratory system tissues. These synthesized miRNAs may be delivered to humansinnon-viral delivery systems such as liposomes like exosome (extracellular vesicle), polymer-based carriers, or inorganic nanoparticles, which are considered to be more suitable for human use.
Unlocking challenges and opportunities presented by COVID-19 pandemic for cross-cutting disruption in agri-food and green deal innovations: Quo Vadis?;COVID-19 pandemic is on a trajectory to cause catastrophic global upheaval with the potential to alter geopolitical and socio-economic norms. Many countries are frantically responding with staggering financial stimulus recovery initiatives. This opinion-paper reviews challenges, opportunities, and potential solutions for the post-COVID-19 era that focuses on intensive sustaining of agri-food supply chain in tandem with meeting the high demand for new green deal innovation. For example, the development of wet peatland innovation, known as Paludiculture, can intensively sustain and blend agri-food and green innovations that will help support COVID-19 pandemic transitioning. The future looks bright for the creation of new sustainability multi-actor innovation hubs that will support, connect, and enable businesses to recover and pivot beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The nexus between first ‘Green Deal’ initiative supporting 64 selected European Startups and SMEs (European Innovation Council) and 43 Irish Disruptive Technology projects are addressed in the context of cross-cutting developments and relevance to COVID-19. Candidate areas for future consideration will focus on climate action, digitization, manufacturing, and sustainable food production, security, and waste mitigation. Recommendations are also provided to facilitate community transitioning, training, enterprise, and employment to low carbon economy.
;This study aimed to predict the short-term of confirmed cases of covid-19 and IBEX in Spain by using SutteARIMA method. Confirmed data of Covid-19 in Spanish was obtained from Worldometer and Spain Stock Market data (IBEX 35) was data obtained from Yahoo Finance. Data started from 12 February 2020–09 April 2020 (the date on Covid-19 was detected in Spain). The data from 12 February 2020–02 April 2020 using to fitting with data from 03 April 2020 – 09 April 2020. Based on the fitting data, we can conducted short-term forecast for 3 future period (10 April 2020 – 12 April 2020 for Covid-19 and 14 April 2020 – 16 April 2020 for IBEX). In this study, the SutteARIMA method will be used. For the evaluation of the forecasting methods, we applied forecasting accuracy measures, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Based on the results of ARIMA and SutteARIMA forecasting methods, it can be concluded that the SutteARIMA method is more suitable than ARIMA to calculate the daily forecasts of confirmed cases of Covid-19 and IBEX in Spain. The MAPE value of 0.036 (smaller than 0.03 compared to MAPE value of ARIMA) for confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Spain and was in the amount of 0.026 for IBEX stock. At the end of the analysis, this study used the SutteARIMA method, this study calculated daily forecasts of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Spain from 10 April 2020 until 12 April 2020 i.e. 158925
Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist anakinra in association with remdesivir in severe COVID-19: A case report;We report the first successful treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra, in association with the most promising and available antiviral therapy, of a severe case of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We describe the diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case, including the respiratory failure at presentation, the progression to a scenario characterized by profound inflammatory dysregulation similar to that observed during macrophage activation syndrome, and the clinical improvement after treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra. This case highlights the high tolerability and the interesting immunomodulatory profile of the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra in the setting of severe COVID-19 associated with remdesivir therapy. Further studies are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of this combination strategy in the treatment of this emerging infection.
Estimating the instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 in China;The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China has been basically controlled. However, the global epidemic of COVID-19 is worsening. We established a method to estimate the instant case fatality rate (CFR) and cure rate of COVID-19 in China.
Estimation of the probable outbreak size of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in social gathering events and industrial activities;The reproduction number (
;The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused concerns globally. On 30 January WHO has declared it as a global health emergency. The easy spread of this virus made people to wear a mask as precautionary route, use gloves and hand sanitizer on a daily basis that resulted in generation of a massive amount of medical wastes in the environment. Millions of people have been put on lockdown in order to reduce the transmission of the virus. This epidemic has also changed the people's life style
Clinical features of COVID-19 in elderly patients: A comparison with young and middle-aged patients;Due to the general susceptibility of new coronaviruses, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of elderly and young patients may be different.
COVID-19 and routine childhood immunization in Africa: Leveraging systems thinking and implementation science to improve immunization system performance;One of the routine health services that is being disrupted by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Africa is childhood immunization. This is because the immunization system relies on functioning health facilities and stable communities to be effective. Its disruption increases the risk of epidemics of vaccine-preventable diseases, which could increase child mortality. Therefore, policymakers must quickly identify robust and context-specific strategies to rapidly scale-up routine immunization in order to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on their national immunization performance. To achieve this, we propose a paradigm shift towards systems thinking and use of implementation science in immunization decision-making. Systems thinking can inform a more nuanced and holistic understanding of the interrelationship between COVID-19, its control strategies, and childhood immunization. Tools like causal loop diagrams can be used to explicitly illustrate the systems structure by identifying feedback loops. Once mapped and leverage points for interventions have been identified, implementation science can be used to guide the rapid uptake and utilization of multifaceted evidence-based innovations in complex practice settings. As Africa re-strategizes for the post-2020 era, these emerging fields could contribute significantly in accelerating progress towards universal access to vaccines for all children on the continent despite COVID-19.
Understanding transmission and intervention for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States;The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severely threatens the public health worldwide, but the transmission mechanism and the effectiveness of mitigation measures remain uncertain. Here we assess the role of airborne transmission in spreading the disease and the effectiveness of face covering in preventing inter-human transmission for the top-fifteen infected U.S. states during March 1 and May 18, 2020. For all fifteen states, the curve of total confirmed infections exhibits an initial sub-exponential growth and a subsequent linear growth after implementing social distancing/stay-at-home orders. The linearity extends one to two months for the six states without mandated face covering and to the onset of mandated face covering for the other nine states with this measure, reflecting a dynamic equilibrium between first-order transmission kinetics and intervention. For the states with mandated face covering, significant deviation from this linearity and curve flattening occur after the onset of this measure for seven states, with exceptions for two states. Most states exhibit persistent upward trends in the daily new infections after social distancing/stay-at-home orders, while reversed downward or slowing trends occur for eight states after implementing mandated face covering. The inadequacy of social distancing and stay-at-home measures alone in preventing inter-human transmission is reflected by the continuous linear growth in the total infection curve after implementing these measures, which is mainly driven by airborne transmission. We estimate that the number of the total infections prevented by face covering reaches ~252,000 on May 18 in seven states, which is equivalent to ~17% of the total infections in the nation. We conclude that airborne transmission and face covering play the dominant role in spreading the disease and flattening the total infection curve, respectively. Our findings provide policymakers and the public with compelling evidence that universal face covering, in conjunction with social distancing and hand hygiene, represents the maximal protection against inter-human transmission and the combination of these intervention measures with rapid and extensive testing as well as contact tracing is crucial in containing the COVID-19 pandemic.
The effects of regional climatic condition on the spread of COVID-19 at global scale;The pandemic outbreak of the novel coronavirus epidemic disease (COVID-19) is spreading like a diffusion-reaction in the world and almost 208 countries and territories are being affected around the globe. It became a sever health and socio-economic problem, while the world has no vaccine to combat this virus. This research aims to analyze the connection between the fast spread of COVID-19 and regional climate parameters over a global scale. In this research, we collected the data of COVID-19 cases from the time of 1st reported case to the 5th June 2020 in different affected countries and regional climatic parameters data from January 2020 to 5th June 2020. It was found that most of the countries located in the relatively lower temperature region show a rapid increase in the COVID-19 cases than the countries locating in the warmer climatic regions despite their better socio-economic conditions. A correlation between metrological parameters and COVID-19 cases was observed. Average daylight hours are correlated to total the COVID-19 cases with a coefficient of determination of 0.42, while average high-temperature shows a correlation of 0.59 and 0.42 with total COVID-19 cases and death cases respectively. The finding of the study will help international health organizations and local administrations to combat and well manage the spread of COVID-19.
Spatiotemporal pattern of COVID-19 and government response in South Korea (as of May 31, 2020);The aim of this study was to assess how coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clustered across districts in South Korea and to assess whether the pattern and duration of clusters changed following the country's containment strategy.
;Novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) originating from China has rapidly crossed borders, infecting people throughout the whole world. This phenomenon has led to a massive public reaction
Autoimmunity to ACE2 as a possible cause of tissue inflammation in Covid-19;The delayed lung damage after SARS-CoV-2 infection may be caused by an autoimmune response to ACE2 induced by forced presentation of the ACE2 protein in a complex with CoV Spike in Fc Receptor positive Antigen Presenting Cells in the lung. The likelihood that this hypothesis is valid is 
Changes in U.S. air pollution during the COVID-19 pandemic;The COVID-19 global pandemic has likely affected air quality due to extreme changes in human behavior. We assessed air quality during the COVID-19 pandemic for fine particulate matter (PM
Transmission potential and severity of COVID-19 in South Korea;Since the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) identified on Jan 20, 2020, in South Korea, the number of cases rapidly increased, resulting in 6284 cases including 42 deaths as of Mar 6, 2020. To examine the growth rate of the outbreak, we present the first study to report the reproduction number of COVID-19 in South Korea.
The powerful immune system against powerful COVID-19: A hypothesis;On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. Since December 2019, the world has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but the factors affecting the immune system against COVID-19 have not been well described. In this article, we provide a novel hypothesis to describe how an increase in cellular adenosine triphosphate (c-ATP) can potentially improve the efficiency of innate and adaptive immune systems to either prevent or fight off COVID-19.
Nutritional status of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19);The relationship between immunity and nutrition is well known and its role in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is also being paid greater attention. However, the nutritional status of COVID-19 patients is unknown. Vitamins B1, B6, B12, D (25-hydroxyvitamin D), folate, selenium, and zinc levels were measured in 50 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A total of 76% of the patients were vitamin D deficient and 42% were selenium deficient. No significant increase in the incidence of deficiency was found for vitamins B1, B6, and B12. folate, and zinc in patients with COVID-19. The COVID-19 group showed significantly lower vitamin D values than the healthy control group (150 people, age/sex matching). Severe vitamin D deficiency (based on 10 ng/dL) was found in 24% of the patients in the COVID-19 group and 7.3% of the control group. Among 12 patients with respiratory distress, 11 (91.7%) were deficient in at least one nutrient. However, patients without respiratory distress showed deficiency in 30/38 people (78.9%, 
A vulnerability-based approach to human-mobility reduction for countering COVID-19 transmission in London while considering local air quality;An ecologic analysis was conducted to explore the correlation between air pollution, and COVID-19 cases and fatality rates in London. The analysis demonstrated a strong correlation (R
Household secondary attack rate of COVID-19 and associated determinants in Guangzhou, China: a retrospective cohort study;As of June 8, 2020, the global reported number of COVID-19 cases had reached more than 7 million with over 400 000 deaths. The household transmissibility of the causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains unclear. We aimed to estimate the secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 among household and non-household close contacts in Guangzhou, China, using a statistical transmission model.
Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China: A systematic review and meta-analysis;To better inform efforts to treat and control the current outbreak with a comprehensive characterization of COVID-19.
Can we predict the occurrence of COVID-19 cases? Considerations using a simple model of growth;This study aimed to present a simple model to follow the evolution of the COVID-19 (CV-19) pandemic in different countries. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) and its first derivative were employed for this task. The simulations showed that it is almost impossible to predict based on the initial CV-19 cases (1st 2nd or 3rd weeks) how the pandemic will evolve. However, the results presented here revealed that this approach can be used as an alternative for the exponential growth model, traditionally employed as a prediction model, and serve as a valuable tool for investigating how protective measures are changing the evolution of the pandemic.
Asymmetric nexus between temperature and COVID-19 in the top ten affected provinces of China: A current application of quantile-on-quantile approach;The present study examines the asymmetrical effect of temperature on COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease) from 22 January 2020 to 31 March 2020 in the 10 most affected provinces in China. This study used the Sim & Zhou' quantile-on-quantile (QQ) approach to analyze how the temperature quantities affect the different quantiles of COVID-19. Daily COVID-19 and, temperature data collected from the official websites of the Chinese National Health Commission and Weather Underground Company (WUC) respectively. Empirical results have shown that the relationship between temperature and COVID-19 is mostly positive for Hubei, Hunan, and Anhui, while mostly negative for Zhejiang and Shandong provinces. The remaining five provinces Guangdong, Henan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Heilongjiang are showing the mixed trends. These differences among the provinces can be explained by the differences in the number of COVID-19 cases, temperature, and the province's overall hospital facilitations. The study concludes that maintaining a safe and comfortable atmosphere for patients while COVID-19 is being treated may be rational.
;The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which first emerged in Hubei province, China, has become a pandemic. However, data regarding the effects of meteorological factors on its transmission are limited and inconsistent. A mechanism-based parameterisation scheme was developed to investigate the association between the scaled transmission rate (STR) of COVID-19 and the meteorological parameters in 20 provinces/municipalities located on the plains in China. We obtained information on the scale of population migrated from Wuhan, the world epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak, into the study provinces/municipalities using mobile-phone positioning system and big data techniques. The highest STRs were found in densely populated metropolitan areas and in cold provinces located in north-eastern China. Population density had a non-linear relationship with disease spread (linearity index, 0.9). Among various meteorological factors, only temperature was significantly associated with the STR after controlling for the effect of population density. A negative and exponential relationship was identified between the transmission rate and the temperature (correlation coefficient, −0.56
Hydrogen peroxide and viral infections: A literature review with research hypothesis definition in relation to the current covid-19 pandemic;We reviewed the literature concerning the innate response from nasal and oral epithelial cells and their reaction to hydrogen peroxide (H
Estimation of the potential spread risk of COVID-19: Occurrence assessment along the Yangtze, Han, and Fu River basins in Hubei, China;Given that the novel coronavirus was detected in stool and urine from diagnosed patients, the potential risk of its transmission through the water environment might not be ignored. In the current study, to investigate the spread possibility of COVID-19 via the environmental media, three typical rivers (Yangtze, Han, and Fu River) and watershed cities in Hubei province of China were selected, and a more comprehensive risk assessment analysis method was built with a risk index proposed. Results showed that the risk index in the Yangtze River Basin is about 10
COVID-19: Lessons for the climate change emergency;The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak pandemic is now a global crisis. It has caused 9+ million confirmed cases and 400,000+ deaths at the time of writing and triggered unprecedented preventative measures that have confined a substantial portion of the global population and established ‘social distancing’ as a new global behavioral norm. The COVID-19 crisis has affected all aspects of everyday life and work, and heavily impacted the global economy. This crisis also offers unprecedented insights into how the global climate crisis may be managed, as there are many parallels between the COVID-19 crisis and what we expect from the imminent global climate emergency. Reflecting upon the challenges of today's crisis may help us better prepare for the future. Here we compile a list, by no means comprehensive, of the similarities and differences between the two crises, and the lessons we can learn from them: (i) High momentum trends, (ii) Irreversible changes, (iii) Social and spatial inequality, (iv) Weakening of international solidarity, and (v) Less costly to prevent than to cure.
New loss of smell and taste: Uncommon symptoms in COVID-19 patients on Nord Franche-Comte cluster, France;New loss of smell or taste was not included as common symptoms of COVID-19 until March 2020 when the pandemic started in Western countries. We want to describe the prevalence and features of anosmia and dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients.
Containing the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Meteorological factors and control strategies;The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally and the meteorological factors vary greatly across the world. Understanding the effect of meteorological factors and control strategies on COVID-19 transmission is critical to contain the epidemic. Using individual-level data in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and the number of confirmed cases in other regions, we explore the effect of temperature, relative humidity, and control measures on the spread of COVID-19. We find that high temperature mitigates the transmission of the disease. High relative humidity promotes COVID-19 transmission when temperature is low, but tends to reduce transmission when temperature is high. Implementing classical control measures can dramatically slow the spread of the disease. However, due to the occurrence of pre-symptomatic infections, the effect of the measures to shorten treatment time is markedly reduced and the importance of contact quarantine and social distancing increases.
Clinical features and short-term outcomes of elderly patients with COVID-19;The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global public health emergency.
;Corona virus disease (COVID-19) has been declared as a controllable pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 though is a predominantly respiratory illness
Repercussions of COVID-19 pandemic on municipal solid waste management: Challenges and opportunities;The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global emergency and has raised social and economic concerns which will also spill over to environmental issues. Amid this natural experiment, current study evaluates prevailing municipal solid waste (MSW) management practices, with the emphasis on MSW treatment and disposal facilities in select developed and developing countries. The data and information used in this paper is collected from several scientific research papers from different disciplines, publications from governments and multilateral agencies and media reports. Despite limited literature on MSW management during such pandemics, this article presets a global backdrop of MSW management during COVID-19 outbreak and examines various aspects of MSW management. Discussion includes identifying parameters of disease transmission through solid waste handling, consequences of medical waste surge on current municipal waste treatment and disposal systems. Further, based on previous pandemic and disaster waste management studies, this study also presents challenges and opportunities in the aftermath of the ongoing pandemic. The paper recommends alternatives approaches for MSW treatment and disposal and outlines the future scope of work to achieve sustainable waste management during and aftermath of the pandemics.
Impact of COVID-19 outbreak measures of lockdown on the Italian Carbon Footprint;Stringent lockdown measures implemented in Italy to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 are generating unprecedented economic impacts. However, the environmental consequences associated with the temporary shutdown and recovery of industrial and commercial activities are still not fully understood. Using the well-known carbon footprint (CF) indicator, this paper provides a comprehensive estimation of environmental effects due to the COVID-19 outbreak lockdown measures in Italy. Our aim was to quantify the CF associated with the consumption of energy by any economic activity and region in Italy during the lockdown, and then compare these environmental burdens with the CF calculated for analogous periods from 2015 to 2019 (~March and April). Complementarily, we also conducted a scenario analysis to estimate the post-lockdown CF impact in Italy. A consumption-based approach was applied according to the principles of the established Life Cycle Assessment method. The CF was therefore quantified as a sum of direct and indirect greenhouse gases (GHGs) released from domestically produced and imported energy metabolism flows, excluding the exports. Our findings indicate that the CF in the lockdown period is ~−20% lower than the mean CF calculated for the past. This means avoided GHGs in between ~5.6 and ~10.6 Mt CO
Electric fans: A potential stay-at-home cooling strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic this summer?;Current public health guidance designed to protect individuals against extreme heat and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is seemingly discordant, yet during the northern hemisphere summer, we are faced with the imminent threat of their simultaneous existence. Here we examine the environmental limits of electric fan-use in the context of the United States summer as a potential stay-at-home cooling strategy that aligns with existing efforts to mitigate the spread of SARS-COV-2.
COVID-19: Loss of bridging between innate and adaptive immunity?;COVID-19 has spread to most countries in the world. However, there are some striking differences in how COVID-19 is behaving in different age groups. While data on COVID-19 is limited, children appear to be less susceptible to severe disease. These unique characteristics may be considered as a potential link to understanding the immune system and response in COVID-19 and lead to an effective cure to the disease. We suggest a possible role of loss of bridging between innate and adaptive immunity in COVID-19 and a potential treatment modality also discussed.
Alpha-lipoic acid may protect patients with diabetes against COVID-19 infection;COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly worldwide, and drug selection can affect the morbidity and mortality of the disease positively or negatively. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a potent antioxidant and reduces oxidative stress and inhibits activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB). ALA reduces ADAM17 activity and ACE2 upregulation. ALA is known to have antiviral effects against some viruses. ALA may show antiviral effect by reducing NF-kB activation and alleviating redox reactions. ALA increases the intracellular glutathione strengthens the human host defense. ALA activates ATP dependent K
Household representative sample strategy for COVID-19 large-scale population screening;In the advent of COVID-19 pandemic, testing is highly essential to be able to isolate, treat infected persons, and finally curb transmission of this infectious respiratory disease. Group testing has been used previously for various infectious diseases and recently reported for large-scale population testing of COVID-19. However, possible sample dilution as a result of large pool sizes has been reported, limiting testing methods’ detection sensitivity. Moreover, the need to sample all individuals prior to pooling overburden the limited resources such as test kits. An alternative proposed strategy where test is performed on pooled samples from individuals representing different households is presented here. This strategy intends to improve group testing method through the reduction in the number of samples collected and pooled during large-scale population testing. Moreover, it introduces database system which enables continuous monitoring of the population’s virus exposure for better decision making.
;In March of 2020, the province of Ontario declared a State of Emergency (SOE) to reduce the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This disruption to the economy provided an opportunity to measure change in air pollution when the population spends more time at home with fewer trips. Hourly air pollution observations were obtained for fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone from the Ontario air monitoring network for 2020 and the previous five years. The analysis is focused on a five-week period during the SOE with a previous five-week period used as a control. Fine particulate matter did not show any significant reductions during the SOE. Ozone concentrations at 12 of the 32 monitors were lower than any of the previous five-years
Clinical and virological data of the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe: a case series;On Dec 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people at Wuhan, Hubei Province. The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020.
Duration of viral shedding in asymptomatic or mild cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from a cruise ship: A single-hospital experience in Tokyo, Japan;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the cause of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first reported in Wuhan, China, and now has spread across the world as a global pandemic. The propagation from asymptomatic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive individuals represents a complicating factor in the efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the course of PCR assays and the duration of viral shedding in 23 asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients from the cruise ship who were admitted to our hospital. Among these 23 cases, the median duration of viral shedding was 19 days (range, 6–37 days) from initial viral detection. Eight cases (35%) had another positive PCR result after testing negative once. Although the duration of viral shedding was approximately three weeks, the infectivity and transmissibility period from asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 cases is unclear. Further studies are needed to determine how long such asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 cases have infectivity.
Use of anakinra in severe COVID-19: A case report;Coronavirus disease 19 is a global healthcare emergency with a high lethality rate. Relevant inflammatory cytokine storm is associated with severity of disease, and IL1 inhibition is a cornerstone treatment for hyperinflammatory diseases. We present here the case of a patient with critical COVID-19 successfully treated with IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra).
Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study;Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.
Neutralizing antibodies mediate virus-immune pathology of COVID-19;SARS-CoV-2 is a novel beta-coronavirus causing over 200.000 lethal cases within six months of first infecting humans. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, a form of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). COVID-19 is characterized by two phases: the first resembles the flu with pneumonia, but after about seven or eight days the disease suddenly worsens to a sepsis-like syndrome. It is difficult to explain this virus-immune-pathology sequence from virology or immunology only. This paper hypothesizes that host-produced anti-spike protein antibodies are responsible for immune-induced viral dissemination. Subsequently, systemic distribution of virus-antibodies complexes activates the immune pathology observed in severe COVID-19.
Impacts of geographic factors and population density on the COVID-19 spreading under the lockdown policies of China;The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has a high spreading rate and a high fatality rate. To control the rapid spreading of COVID-19 virus, Chinese government ordered lockdown policies since late January 2020. The aims of this study are to quantify the relationship between geographic information (i.e., latitude, longitude and altitude) and cumulative infected population, and to unveil the importance of the population density in the spreading speed during the lockdown. COVID-19 data during the period from December 8, 2019 to April 8, 2020 were collected before and after lockdown. After discovering two important geographic factors (i.e., latitude and altitude) by estimating the correlation coefficients between each of them and cumulative infected population, two linear models of cumulative infected population and COVID-19 spreading speed were constructed based on these two factors. Overall, our findings from the models showed a negative correlation between the provincial daily cumulative COVID-19 infected number and latitude/altitude. In addition, population density is not an important factor in COVID-19 spreading under strict lockdown policies. Our study suggests that lockdown policies of China can effectively restrict COVID-19 spreading speed.
Remdesivir in adults with severe COVID-19: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial;No specific antiviral drug has been proven effective for treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models.
Impact of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China;A COVID-19 outbreak emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and developed into a global pandemic during March 2020. The effects of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in China are unknown. Data on COVID-19 daily confirmed cases and daily mean temperatures were collected from 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China between Jan. 20 and Feb. 29, 2020. Locally weighted regression and smoothing scatterplot (LOESS), distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs), and random-effects meta-analysis were used to examine the relationship between daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 and temperature conditions. The daily number of new cases peaked on Feb. 12, and then decreased. The daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 had a biphasic relationship with temperature (with a peak at 10 °C), and the daily incidence of COVID-19 decreased at values below and above these values. The overall epidemic intensity of COVID-19 reduced slightly following days with higher temperatures with a relative risk (RR) was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). A random-effect meta-analysis including 28 provinces in mainland China, we confirmed the statistically significant association between temperature and RR during the study period (Coefficient = −0.0100, 95% CI: −0.0125, −0.0074). The DLNMs in Hubei Province (outside of Wuhan) and Wuhan showed similar patterns of temperature. Additionally, a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model, with adjustment for climatic factors, was used to provide a complete characterization of the impact of climate on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic.
Rethinking interleukin-6 blockade for treatment of COVID-19;Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine with effects in immune regulation, inflammation, and infection. The use of drugs that inhibit IL-6 biological activity has been proposed as a treatment for patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rationale for this approach includes commitment to the concept that inflammation is a cause of lung damage in COVID-19 and belief that IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory molecule. Observational data thought to support IL-6 inhibition include elevated circulating IL-6 levels in COVID-19 patients and association between elevated IL-6 and poor clinical outcomes. However, IL-6 has significant anti-inflammatory properties, which calls into question the rationale for employing IL-6 blockade to suppress inflammation-induced tissue injury. Also, studies suggesting a beneficial role for IL-6 in the host response to infection challenge the strategy of using IL-6 blockade to treat COVID-19. In studies of recombinant IL-6 injected into human volunteers, IL-6 levels exceeding those measured in COVID-19 patients have been observed with no pulmonary adverse events or other organ damage. These observations question the role of IL-6 as a contributing factor in COVID-19. Clinical experience with IL-6 receptor antagonists such as tocilizumab demonstrates increase in severe and opportunistic infections, raising concern about using tocilizumab and similar agents to treat COVID-19. Trials of drugs to inhibit IL-6 activity in COVID-19 are ongoing and will shed light on the role of IL-6 in COVID-19 pathogenesis. However, until more information is available, providers should exercise caution in prescribing these therapies given the potential for patient harm.
Neurosensory dysfunction: A diagnostic marker of early COVID-19;To describe neurosensory dysfunctions, including hyposmia, hypogeusia, and tinnitus, in patients with COVID-19.
Meteorological impact on the COVID-19 pandemic: A study across eight severely affected regions in South America;The role of meteorological factors in the transmission of the COVID-19 still needs to be determined. In this study, the daily new cases of the eight severely affected regions in four countries of South America and their corresponding meteorological data (average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average wind speed, visibility, absolute humidity) were collected. Daily number of confirmed and incubative cases, as well as time-dependent reproductive number (R
Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine: a dose-escalation, open-label, non-randomised, first-in-human trial;A vaccine to protect against COVID-19 is urgently needed. We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain.
The association between obesity and poor outcome after COVID-19 indicates a potential therapeutic role for montelukast;It is widely believed that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus triggers a disproportionate immune response which causes a devastating systemic injury, particularly in individuals with obesity, itself a chronic, multi-organ inflammatory disease. Immune cells accumulate in visceral adipose tissue and together with paracrine adipocytes release a wide range of biologically active cytokines (including IL-1β, IL5, IL6 and IL8) that can result in both local, pulmonary and systemic inflammation. A more intense ‘cytokine storm’ is postulated as the mechanism behind the extreme immune response seen in severe COVID-19.
Radiological findings from 81 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study;A cluster of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were successively reported in Wuhan, China. We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course.
Mesenchymal stem cell (MSc) secretome: A possible therapeutic strategy for intensive-care COVID-19 patients;As an emerging global health challenge, COVID-19 requires international knowledge to reach novel possible therapeutic strategies, especially for intensive-care patients. During the early stages of infection, pneumocytes II are the primary infected cells, harming the respiratory system. We have previous evidence in murine models that MSc’s secretome can be used to treat pulmonary injuries induced with bleomycin, due to its content: growth factors, extracellular vesicles, and exosomes. We hypothesize and strongly recommend MSc secretome testing and production, in 
Clusters of COVID-19 associated with Purim celebration in the Jewish community in Marseille, France, March 2020;We investigated possible COVID-19 epidemic clusters and their common sources of exposure that led to a sudden increase in the incidence of COVID-19 in the Jewish community of Marseille between March 15 and March 20, 2020.
Amantadine as a drug to mitigate the effects of COVID-19;The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the world. At this time, there is no vaccine that can help people prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Can volcanic trace elements facilitate Covid-19 diffusion? A hypothesis stemming from the Mount Etna area, Sicily;In December 2019, severe cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology were reported in Wuhan city, in China. Lately, the pneumonia was related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the diseases was termed coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). At the end of January 2020, the infection spread all over Italy, but with high infection rates and mortality in the northern part, especially in Lombardy, the most industrialized and polluted region of the country. It is noteworthy that a strong association between severe viral respiratory disease and air pollution has been described. Air pollutant could be solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases and can be of natural origin (such as ash from a volcanic eruption) or released from motor vehicle depletes (carbon monoxide gas) or factories (sulfur dioxide). Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of sulphuric acid, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrochloric acid into the atmosphere. Pulmunary diseases spread by means of small droplets in the breath, also called aerosols, and air pollution may facilitate the outside survival of viruses. We suppose that ash and gases emitted from the Mount Etna contributed to air pollution, potentially favouring the major contagion of COVID-19 in the eastern flank of the mountain, as in Catania city. In fact, ash and gases (with regard to radon) are usually particularly intense in winter, with a reduction of emission of specific metals with warmer weather. This is the first paper that elaborates the hypothesis of a potential role of volcanic gases and heavy metals-related air pollution, combined to specific climatic conditions and regional topography, in favouring severe COVID-19 diffusion in Sicily. Clinical and epidemiological studies are needed to support the hypothesis and plan the due prevention and awareness-raising campaigns.
Recombinant protein targeting and opsonizing spike glycoprotein for enhancing SARS-CoV-2 phagocytosis;The present hypothesis suggests an innovative therapeutic strategy to cease Covid 19 infection. It is based on the inhibition of Spike glycoprotein and ACE-2 receptor interaction that provides the entry of virus in human host cells, by targeting the S protein with a recombinant molecule made of the ACE-2 receptor ectodomain and an opsonin, the formed complex would enhance its phagocytosis.
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and control measures on air quality and aerosol light absorption in Southwestern China;China has been performing nationwide social lockdown by releasing the Level 1 response to major public health emergencies (RMPHE) to struggle against the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak since late January 2020. During the Level 1 RMPHE, social production and public transport were maintained at minimal levels, and residents stayed in and worked from home. The universal impact of anthropogenic activities on air pollution can be evaluated by comparing it with air quality under such extreme conditions. We investigated the concentration of both gaseous and particulate pollutants and aerosol light absorption at different levels of (RMPHE) in an urban area of southwestern China. During the lockdown, PM
Diagnostic value and dynamic variance of serum antibody in coronavirus disease 2019;To investigate the diagnostic value of serological testing and dynamic variance of serum antibody in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Kawasaki disease shock syndrome or toxic shock syndrome in children and the relationship with COVID-19;Most pediatric patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms. However, in the last two months, first in Europe and recently in the United States, a small number of children have developed a more severe inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19, which often leads to hospitalization and sometimes requires intensive care. A potential relationship was observed, especially between the occurrence of the Kawasaki disease and viral upper respiratory tract infections.

Bats in Ecosystems and their Wide Spectrum of Viral Infectious Threats: SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging viruses;Bats have populated earth for approximately 52 million years, serving as natural reservoirs for a variety of viruses through the course of evolution. Transmission of highly pathogenic viruses from bats has been suspected and linked to a spectrum of emerging infectious diseases in humans and animals worldwide. Examples of such viruses include Marburg, Ebola, Nipah, Hendra, Influenza A, Dengue, Equine Encephalitis viruses, Lyssaviruses, Madariaga and Coronaviruses, involving the now pandemic Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Herein, we provide a comprehensive review on the diversity, reservoirs, and geographical distribution of the main bat viruses and their potential for cross-species transmission.
Estimation of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone-System (RAAS)-Inhibitor effect on COVID-19 outcome: A Meta-analysis;Some studies of hospitalized patients suggested that the risk of death and/or severe illness due to COVID-19 is not associated with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin II receptor type 1 blockers (ARBs). Nevertheless, some controversy still exists and there is limited information of the ACEIs/ARBs effect size on COVID-19 prognosis.
Rethinking and optimising plastic waste management under COVID-19 pandemic: Policy solutions based on redesign and reduction of single-use plastics and personal protective equipment;Plastics have been on top of the political agenda in Europe and across the world to reduce plastic leakage and pollution. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted plastic reduction policies at the regional and national levels and induced significant changes in plastic waste management with potential for negative impacts in the environment and human health. This paper provides an overview of plastic policies and discusses the readjustments of these policies during the COVID-19 pandemic along with their potential environmental implications.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO): does it have a role in the treatment of severe COVID-19?;The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged since December 2019 in Wuhan city, and has quickly spread throughout China and other countries. To date, no specific treatment has been proven to be effective for SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to World Health Organization (WHO), management of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has mainly focused on infection prevention, case detection and monitoring, and supportive care. Given to the previous experience, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been proven to be an effective therapy in the treatment of respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). On the basis of similar principle, ECMO may be also an effective therapy in the treatment of severe COVID-19. In this study, we described and discussed the clinical outcomes of ECMO for ARDS patients, ECMO use for severe COVID-19 in China, the indications of ECMO use, and some important issues associated with ECMO.

5-Fluorouracil in combination with deoxyribonucleosides and deoxyribose as possible therapeutic options for the Coronavirus, COVID-19 infection;The recent global pandemic created by the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, started in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has generated panic, both in term of human death (4–5% of infected patients identified through testing) and the global economy. Human suffering
Real-time estimation and prediction of mortality caused by COVID-19 with patient information based algorithm;The global COVID-19 outbreak is worrisome both for its high rate of spread, and the high case fatality rate reported by early studies and now in Italy. We report a new methodology, the Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA), for estimating the death rate of a disease in real-time using publicly available data collected during an outbreak. PIBA estimated the death rate based on data of the patients in Wuhan and then in other cities throughout China. The estimated days from hospital admission to death was 13 (standard deviation (SD), 6 days). The death rates based on PIBA were used to predict the daily numbers of deaths since the week of February 25, 2020, in China overall, Hubei province, Wuhan city, and the rest of the country except Hubei province. The death rate of COVID-19 ranges from 0.75% to 3% and may decrease in the future. The results showed that the real death numbers had fallen into the predicted ranges. In addition, using the preliminary data from China, the PIBA method was successfully used to estimate the death rate and predict the death numbers of the Korean population. In conclusion, PIBA can be used to efficiently estimate the death rate of a new infectious disease in real-time and to predict future deaths. The spread of 2019-nCoV and its case fatality rate may vary in regions with different climates and temperatures from Hubei and Wuhan. PIBA model can be built based on known information of early patients in different countries.

Why is SARS-CoV-2 infection more severe in obese men? The gut lymphatics – Lung axis hypothesis;Consistent observations report increased severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in overweight men with cardiovascular factors. As the visceral fat possesses an intense immune activity, is involved in metabolic syndrome and is at the crossroad between the intestines, the systemic circulation and the lung, we hypothesized that it plays a major role in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV2 presents the ability to infect epithelial cells of the respiratory tract as well as the intestinal tract. Several factors may increase intestinal permeability including direct enterocyte damage by SARS-CoV2, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and epithelial ischemia secondary to SARS-CoV2- associated endothelial dysfunction. This increase permeability further leads to translocation of microbial components such as MAMPs (microbial-associated molecular pattern), triggering an inflammatory immune response by TLR-expressing cells of the mesentery fat (mostly macrophages and adipocytes). The pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the mesentery fat mediates systemic inflammation and aggravate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) through the mesenteric lymph drainage.
;Recently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2
Ribosomal proteins as a possible tool for blocking SARS-COV 2 virus replication for a potential prospective treatment;Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and has resulted in more than four million cases globally and the death cases exceeded 300,000. Normally, a range of surviving and propagating host factors must be employed for the completion of the infectious process including RPs. Viral protein biosynthesis involves the interaction of numerous RPs with viral mRNA, proteins which are necessary for viruses replication regulation and infection inside the host cells. Most of these interactions are crucial for virus activation and accumulation. However, only small percentage of these proteins is specifically responsible for host cells protection by triggering the immune pathway against virus. This research proposes RPs extracted from 
COVID-19 transmission in Mainland China is associated with temperature and humidity: A time-series analysis;COVID-19 has become a pandemic. The influence of meteorological factors on the transmission and spread of COVID-19 is of interest. This study sought to examine the associations of daily average temperature (AT) and relative humidity (ARH) with the daily counts of COVID-19 cases in 30 Chinese provinces (in Hubei from December 1, 2019 to February 11, 2020 and in other provinces from January 20, 2020 to Februarys 11, 2020). A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was fitted to quantify the province-specific associations between meteorological variables and the daily cases of COVID-19 during the study periods. In the model, the 14-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of AT and ARH, and their interaction were included with time trend and health-seeking behavior adjusted. Their spatial distributions were visualized. AT and ARH showed significantly negative associations with COVID-19 with a significant interaction between them (0.04, 95% confidence interval: 0.004–0.07) in Hubei. Every 1 °C increase in the AT led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 36% to 57% when ARH was in the range from 67% to 85.5%. Every 1% increase in ARH led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 11% to 22% when AT was in the range from 5.04 °C to 8.2 °C. However, these associations were not consistent throughout Mainland China.
Clinical characteristics and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women: a retrospective review of medical records;Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.

Estimating the impact of physical distancing measures in containing COVID-19: an empirical analysis;Epidemic modelling studies predict that physical distancing is critical in containing COVID-19. However, few empirical studies have validated this finding. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of different physical distancing measures in controlling viral transmission.
Does gender influence clinical expression and disease outcomes in COVID-19? A systematic review and meta-analysis;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV) has been recently characterized, and soon spread around the world generating a pandemic. It has been suggested that men are more severely affected by the viral disease (COVID-19) than women.
Short-term effects of specific humidity and temperature on COVID-19 morbidity in select US cities;Little is known about the environmental conditions that drive the spatiotemporal patterns of SARS-CoV-2. Preliminary research suggests an association with meteorological parameters. However, the relationship with temperature and humidity is not yet apparent for COVID-19 cases in US cities first impacted. The objective of this study is to evaluate the association between COVID-19 cases and meteorological parameters in select US cities. A case-crossover design with a distributed lag nonlinear model was used to evaluate the contribution of ambient temperature and specific humidity on COVID-19 cases in select US cities. The case-crossover examines each COVID case as its own control at different time periods (before and after transmission occurred). We modeled the effect of temperature and humidity on COVID-19 transmission using a lag period of 7 days. A subset of 8 cities were evaluated for the relationship with meteorological parameters and 5 cities were evaluated in detail. Short-term exposure to humidity was positively associated with COVID-19 transmission in 4 cities. The associations were small with 3 out of 4 cities exhibiting higher COVID19 transmission with specific humidity that ranged from 6 to 9 g/kg. Our results suggest that weather should be considered in infectious disease modeling efforts. Future work is needed over a longer time period and across different locations to clearly establish the weather-COVID19 relationship.

;The fast-growing outbreak of 2019 novel coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) reached all continents except the Antarctica in merely three months. Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) has a bad clinical outcome, and some reports emphasized the role of cytokine storm and dysfunctions of multiple organs. However, the etiology of severe COVID-19 has been largely unknown. Similar as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is also thought derived from bat coronaviruses. However, it is not pathogenic for bat at all, because free DNA in cytoplasm or blood cannot bring up violent immune response in bat
What do we know about the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in the environment?;In view of the current situation regarding the Covid-19 disease, a discussion is proposed on the need for research focusing on the presence and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in water, soils and other environmental compartments, reached through wastewater and sewage sludge spreading. Also, the evaluation of current treatments for wastewater and sewage sludge, as well as the eventual development of new specific techniques, based on sorption, nanotechnology, etc., would be of great interest for controlling the environmental dissemination of these viruses in the current and eventual future outbreaks.
Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as an independent risk factor for mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19;Several studies have described the clinical characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19), indicating severe patients tended to have higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Whether baseline NLR could be an independent predictor of in-hospital death in Chinese COVID-19 patients remains to be investigated.
The dark cloud with a silver lining: Assessing the impact of the SARS COVID-19 pandemic on the global environment;The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 has caused tremendous suffering and huge economic losses. We hypothesized that extreme measures of partial-to-total shutdown might have influenced the quality of the global environment because of decreased emissions of atmospheric pollutants. We tested this hypothesis using satellite imagery, climatic datasets (temperature, and absolute humidity), and COVID-19 cases available in the public domain. While the majority of the cases were recorded from Western countries, where mortality rates were strongly positively correlated with age, the number of cases in tropical regions was relatively lower than European and North American regions, possibly attributed to faster human-to-human transmission. There was a substantial reduction in the level of nitrogen dioxide (NO
Co-infections in people with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis;In previous influenza pandemics, bacterial co-infections have been a major cause of mortality. We aimed to evaluate the burden of co-infections in patients with COVID-19.
;The Bergamo province, which is extensively affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, is a natural observatory of virus manifestations in the general population. In the past month we recorded an outbreak of Kawasaki disease
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and influenza pandemics;The objective of this Personal View is to compare transmissibility, hospitalisation, and mortality rates for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with those of other epidemic coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and pandemic influenza viruses. The basic reproductive rate (
Assessing the effects of metropolitan-wide quarantine on the spread of COVID-19 in public space and households;Hubei province in China has completed cycle of quarantine-resumption in 23rd Janauary and 8th April 2020, providing a unique opportunity as for now to assess its intervention impact and the pattern of SARS-COV-2 transmission during the quarantine period. In this study, we evaluate the impact of the metropolitan-wide quarantine on the trend and transmission route of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei, China. The intervention reduces more than 70% of new infections in both households and the public space, as well as the deaths caused by COVID-19 pneumonia. Household transmission is the dominant route of disease spread regardless of quarantine. This will provide important evidence and scientific insights to other worldwide countries that are currently under quarantine.
Monitoring approaches for health-care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic;Health-care workers are crucial to any health-care system. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, health-care workers are at a substantially increased risk of becoming infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and could come to considerable harm as a result. Depending on the phase of the pandemic, patients with COVID-19 might not be the main source of SARS-CoV-2 infection and health-care workers could be exposed to atypical patients, infected family members, contacts, and colleagues, or live in communities of active transmission. Clear strategies to support and appropriately manage exposed and infected health-care workers are essential to ensure effective staff management and to engender trust in the workplace. These management strategies should focus on risk stratification, suitable clinical monitoring, low-threshold access to diagnostics, and decision making about removal from and return to work. Policy makers need to support health-care facilities in interpreting guidance during a pandemic that will probably be characterised by fluctuating local incidence of SARS-CoV-2 to mitigate the impact of this pandemic on their workforce.
Evaluation of the lockdowns for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy and Spain after one month follow up;From the end of February, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Spain has been following the footsteps of that in Italy very closely. We have analyzed the trends of incident cases, deaths, and intensive care unit admissions (ICU) in both countries before and after their respective national lockdowns using an interrupted time-series design. Data was analyzed with quasi-Poisson regression using an interaction model to estimate the change in trends. After the first lockdown, incidence trends were considerably reduced in both countries. However, although the slopes have been flattened for all outcomes, the trends kept rising. During the second lockdown, implementing more restrictive measures for mobility, it has been a change in the trend slopes for both countries in daily incident cases and ICUs. This improvement indicates that the efforts overtaken are being successful in flattening the epidemic curve, and reinforcing the belief that we must hold on.
Risk factors of critical & mortal COVID-19 cases: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis;An epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December 2019 and triggered a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). We aimed to find risk factors for the progression of COVID-19 to help reducing the risk of critical illness and death for clinical help.
The spread of COVID-19 virus through population density and wind in Turkey cities;Beyond the contact and respiratory transmission of the COVID-19 virus, it has recently been reported in the literature that humidity, temperature, and air pollution may be effective in spreading the virus. However, taking the measurements regionally suspects the accuracy or validity of the data. In this research, climate values (temperature, humidity, number of sunny days, wind intensity) of 81 provinces in Turkey were collected in March 2020. Also, the population, population density of the provinces, and average air pollution data were taken. The findings of the study showed that population density and wind were effective in spreading the virus and both factors explained for 94% of the variance in virus spreading. Air temperature, humidity, the number of sunny days, and air pollution did not affect the number of cases. Besides, population density mediated the effect of wind speed (9%) on the number of COVID-19 cases. The finding that COVID-19 virus, invisible in the air, spreads more in windy weather indicates that the virus in the air is one threatening factor for humans with the wind speed that increases air circulation.
Pharmacotherapy for reducing saliva and droplet production in airborne procedures may help to decrease the COVID-19 transmission: A hypothesis;The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected health care service practices worldwide. Therefore, a global reaction to prepare health care systems is mandatory. Preventing the transmission of this virus during medical and dental procedures producing airborne particles and droplets, could be considered as one of the main venues in prevention of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission in health care facilities. To the best of our knowledge, no intervention has been approved for this purpose, so the major suggestion in this regard is using personal preventive equipment (PPE) and similar measures as well as other sanitizing practices. Since we do not know how long we should face this universal issue, using antecedent pharmacotherapies for reducing oral-respiratory secretions to combat this virus might play a role in this regard. Given that currently there is no definitive cure for COVID-19, so we hypothesize that, considering drug solutions to reduce saliva and droplet production may be helpful in controlling Coronavirus spread during aerosol and respiratory droplet producing procedures.
Reposition of montelukast either alone or in combination with levocetirizine against SARS-CoV-2;It has been hypothesised that antiallergic medications (AAMs) like montelukast and levocetirizine both the two bitter chloro compounds could be repurposed either alone or combinedly as an antiviral against SARS-CoV-2, like chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ), another two bitter chloro compounds. Both AAMs and CQ/HCQ are bitter tasted chloro compounds. Depending on their these two similar physical properties and the safety and efficacy of AAMs by controlling over post viral episodes as comparing with viral inhibitory activities including SARS-CoV-2 by CQ/HCQ, a reposition of AAMs either alone/combinedly could be rationalised as an antiviral approach to nCoV.
Immuno-pathogenesis of nCOVID-19 and a possible host-directed therapy including anti-inflammatory and anti-viral prostaglandin (PG J;Coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, also known as 2019-nCoV especially in China) replicate and divide in host cells. During this they are partly hidden from the innate immune responses although inflammatory consequences of viral replication still occur. We propose that anti-inflammatory antiviral prostaglandins may not only restrict viral replication but also prevent inflammatory responses in the lungs and other vital organs that are known to be part of the immuno-pathogenesis of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The combination of anti-inflammatory antiviral prostaglandins with interferons may lead to the clearance of viruses inside growth-restricted infected cells. However, further experimental studies and clinical trials should be conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these possible therapies.
The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence is the key factor for deconfinement in France;A new virus, SARS-CoV-2, has spread world-wide since December 2019, probably affecting millions of people and killing thousands. Failure to anticipate the spread of the virus now seriously threatens many health systems. We have designed a model for predicting the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France, which is based on seroprevalence and makes it possible to anticipate the deconfinement strategy.
COVID-19-related complications and decompression illness share main features.;A study by Saraiva et al. (2011) demonstrated the presence of Angiotensin II receptors on the erythrocyte membrane. This little-known information should be deemed as crucial as the SARS-CoV-2 relationships with oxygen saturation and the Renine Angiotensin System but it currently remains unexploited.
Inflammation: A bridge between diabetes and COVID-19, and possible management with sitagliptin;Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections experience lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storms in the severe stage of the disease, leading to multi-organ damage. The exact pattern of immune system changes and their condition during the disease process is unclear. The available knowledge has indicated that the NF-kappa-B pathway, which is induced by several mediators, has a significant role in cytokine storm through the various mechanisms. Therefore, identifying the state of the immune cells and the dominant mechanisms for the production of cytokines incorporated in the cytokine storm can be a critical step in the therapeutic approach. On the other hand, some studies identified a higher risk for diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus exhibits a close association with inflammation and increases the chance of developing COVID-19. Patients with diabetes mellitus have shown to have more virus entry, impaired immunity response, less viral elimination, and dysregulated inflammatory cytokines. The parallel analysis of COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus pathogenesis has proposed that the control of the inflammation through the interfering with the critical points of major signaling pathways may provide the new therapeutic approaches. In recent years, the role of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) in chronic inflammation has been proved. Numerous immune cells express the DPP4 protein. DPP4 regulates antibody production, cytokine secretion, and immunoglobulin class switching. DPP4 inhibitors like sitagliptin reduce inflammation intensity in different states.
How mobility habits influenced the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from the Italian case study;Starting from December 2019 the world has faced an unprecedented health crisis caused by the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) due to the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. Within this topic, the aim of the paper was to quantify the effect of mobility habits in the spread of the Coronavirus in Italy through a multiple linear regression model. Estimation results showed that mobility habits represent one of the variables that explains the number of COVID-19 infections jointly with the number of tests/day and some environmental variables (i.e. PM pollution and temperature). Nevertheless, a proximity variable to the first outbreak was also significant, meaning that the areas close to the outbreak had a higher risk of contagion, especially in the initial stage of infection (time-decay phenomena). Furthermore, the number of daily new cases was related to the trips performed three weeks before. This threshold of 21 days could be considered as a sort of 
Environmental pollutant exposure can exacerbate COVID-19 neurologic symptoms;Neurologic symptoms have been reported in some COVID-19 patients. However, little is known on what factors influence the risk of developing these symptoms. While some studies suggest that exposure to pollution is associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, its role is unknown in the development of neurologic symptoms in COVID-19 patients. The response of the central nervous system (CNS) to a SARS-CoV-2 infection may be influenced by its inflammatory state. Interestingly, environmental pollutants such as particulate matter may have neuroinflammatory effects, providing a possible link between exposure to these pollutants and the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS. This article explores the hypothesis that the neurologic symptoms in COVID-19 may be exacerbated through a neuroinflammatory mechanism that is promoted by environmental pollutant exposure.
Disinfection technology and strategies for COVID-19 hospital and bio-medical waste management;The isolation wards, institutional quarantine centers, and home quarantine are generating a huge amount of bio-medical waste (BMW) worldwide since the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The personal protective equipment, testing kits, surgical facemasks, and nitrile gloves are the major contributors to waste volume. Discharge of a new category of BMW (COVID-waste) is of great global concern to public health and environmental sustainability if handled inappropriately. It may cause exponential spreading of this fatal disease as waste acts as a vector for SARS-CoV-2, which survives up to 7 days on COVID-waste (like facemasks). Proper disposal of COVID-waste is therefore immediately requires to lower the threat of pandemic spread and for sustainable management of the environmental hazards. Henceforth, in the present article, disinfection technologies for handling COVID-waste from its separate collection to various physical and chemical treatment steps have been reviewed. Furthermore, policy briefs on the global initiatives for COVID-waste management including the applications of different disinfection techniques have also been discussed with some potential examples effectively applied to reduce both health and environmental risks. This article can be of great significance to the strategy development for preventing/controlling the pandemic of similar episodes in the future.
Early dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study;An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95 333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.

Oral mucosal lesions in a COVID-19 patient: New signs or secondary manifestations?;Some oral manifestations have been observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there is still a question about whether these lesions are due to coronavirus infection or secondary manifestations resulting from the patient's systemic condition. Thus, this article aims to report an additional case of an oral condition in a patient diagnosed with COVID-19. Our patient, a sixty-seven-year-old Caucasian man, tested positive to coronavirus and presented oral manifestations such as recurrent herpes simplex, candidiasis, and geographic tongue. We support the argument that some oral conditions could be secondary to the deterioration of systemic health or due to treatments for COVID-19. The present case report highlights the importance of including dentists in the intensive care unit multi-professional team to improve oral health in critical patients, not only COVID-19 patients, but also, to contribute to evidence-based and decision-making in managing infectious diseases.
Delivery of infection from asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 in a familial cluster;With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 around the world, it has become a worldwide health concern.

Characteristics of COVID-19 infection in Beijing;Since the first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Beijing. We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Beijing.
Connecting clusters of COVID-19: an epidemiological and serological investigation;Elucidation of the chain of disease transmission and identification of the source of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections are crucial for effective disease containment. We describe an epidemiological investigation that, with use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological assays, established links between three clusters of COVID-19.
Occult SARS-CoV-2 infection;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has emerged as a global public health emergency, which is characterized by high infection rate and fatal course. Recent data reported that the test for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA might become positive again after one or two consecutively negative tests. Many researchers are currently evaluating the clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. In this letter, we proposed a possible mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation or relapse after negative nasopharyngeal swabs PCR.
Nocturnal oxygen therapy as an option for early COVID-19;There is currently no effective antiviral therapy or immune-based treatment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The urgent challenge is to prevent the transition of COVID-19 from mild to severe infection. This paper discussed nocturnal oxygen therapy as a new option for people with COVID-19 under home quarantine. It suggested that nocturnal oxygen therapy in the early stages may be helpful in preventing disease progression by inhibiting the rapid replication of the virus and improving the body's antiviral ability.
Early administration of interleukin-6 inhibitors for patients with severe COVID-19 disease is associated with decreased intubation, reduced mortality, and increased discharge;The aim of this observational study was to determine the optimal timing of interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor (IL6ri) administration for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19): From causes to preventions in Hong Kong;Hong Kong has been recently attacked by the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). In late January 2020, it's shown a steadily increasing trend of confirmed cases. There is a 257 in total infected cases confirmed including 4 deaths until 20th of March 2020. To prevent further outbreak of COVID-19, this article discusses the current understanding of COVID-19 and compares with the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in 2003 of Hong Kong from the causes, transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, treatments and preventions to study for an applicable measurement to control COVID-19.
Potential role of zinc supplementation in prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19;Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents the largest current health challenge for the society. At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with this disease are only supportive. It is well known that zinc (Zn) possesses a variety of direct and indirect antiviral properties, which are realized through different mechanisms. Administration of Zn supplement has a potential to enhance antiviral immunity, both innate and humoral, and to restore depleted immune cell function or to improve normal immune cell function, in particular in immunocompromised or elderly patients. Zn may also act in a synergistic manner when co-administered with the standard antiviral therapy, as was demonstrated in patients with hepatitis C, HIV, and SARS-CoV-1. Effectiveness of Zn against a number of viral species is mainly realized through the physical processes, such as virus attachment, infection, and uncoating. Zn may also protect or stabilize the cell membrane which could contribute to blocking of the virus entry into the cell. On the other hand, it was demonstrated that Zn may inhibit viral replication by alteration of the proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in rhinoviruses, HCV, and influenza virus, and diminish the RNA-synthesizing activity of nidoviruses, for which SARS-CoV-2 belongs. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that Zn supplementation may be of potential benefit for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19.
Innate immunity in COVID-19 patients mediated by NKG2A receptors, and potential treatment using Monalizumab, Cholroquine, and antiviral agents;Following the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), studies suggest that the resultant disease (COVID-19) is more severe in individuals with a weakened immune system. Cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells are required to generate an effective immune response against viruses, functional exhaustion of which enables disease progression. Patients with severe COVID-19 present significantly lower lymphocyte, and higher neutrophil, counts in blood. Specifically, CD8
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic lockdown: Effects on air quality in the industrialized Gujarat state of India;Two weeks after the world health organization described the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak as pandemic, the Indian government implemented lockdown of industrial activities and traffic flows across the entire nation between March 24 and May 31, 2020. In this paper, we estimated the improvements achieved in air quality during the lockdown period (March 24, 2020 and April 20, 2020) compared to the pre-lockdown (January 1, 2020 and March 23, 2020) by analyzing PM
Clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective, single-centre, descriptive study;In December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China. The number of affected pregnant women is increasing, but scarce information is available about the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19.
Safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: a preliminary report of a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial;The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be curtailed by vaccination. We assessed the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a viral vectored coronavirus vaccine that expresses the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.
The AI-discovered Aetiology of COVID-19 and Rationale of the Irinotecan+ Etoposide Combination Therapy for Criti- cally Ill COVID-19 Patients;We present the AI-discovered aetiology of COVID-19, based on a precise disease model of COVID-19 built under five weeks that best matches the epidemiological characteristics, transmission dynamics, clinical features, and biological properties of COVID-19 and con- sistently explains the rapidly expanding COVID-19 literature. We present that SARS-CoV- 2 implements a unique unbiased survival strategy of balancing viral replication with viral spread by increasing its dependence on (i) ACE2-expressing cells for viral entry and spread, (ii) PI3K signaling in ACE2-expressing cells for viral replication and egress, and (iii) viral- non-structural-and-accessory-protein-dependent immunomodulation to balance viral spread and viral replication. We further propose the combination of irinotecan (an in-market topoi- somerase I inhibitor) and etoposide (an in-market topoisomerase II inhibitor) could poten- tially be an exceptionally effective treatment to protect critically ill patients from death caused by COVID-19-specific cytokine storms triggered by sepsis, ARDS, and other fatal comorbidities.
Effectiveness of isolation, testing, contact tracing, and physical distancing on reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in different settings: a mathematical modelling study;The isolation of symptomatic cases and tracing of contacts has been used as an early COVID-19 containment measure in many countries, with additional physical distancing measures also introduced as outbreaks have grown. To maintain control of infection while also reducing disruption to populations, there is a need to understand what combination of measures—including novel digital tracing approaches and less intensive physical distancing—might be required to reduce transmission. We aimed to estimate the reduction in transmission under different control measures across settings and how many contacts would be quarantined per day in different strategies for a given level of symptomatic case incidence.
Urgent need for evaluating agonists of angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis for treating patients with COVID-19;ACE2 is a receptor of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells, and its upregulation has been implicated in increasing susceptibility of individuals to this infection. The clinical picture of COVID-19 suggests a role of ACE2 blockade, rather than its overexpression, in causing the pathogenesis. ACE2 blockade results in increased angiotensin II activity with simultaneous hampering of functions of angiotensin-(1-7)/MasR axis. Acute respiratory distress due to interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, cardiomyopathy and shock reported in COVID-19 patients can be explained by imbalanced angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) activities. Failure of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers to control the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections indicates the importance of simultaneous induction of angiotensin-(1-7)/MasR axis for correcting pathological conditions in COVID-19 through its anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and cardioprotective roles. MasR agonists have also shown organ protective effects in a number of animal studies. Unfortunately, these agonists have not been tested in clinical studies. Their evaluation in seriously ill COVID-19 patients is urgently warranted to reduce mortality due to infection.
Wastewater surveillance for Covid-19: An African perspective;The COVID-19 pandemic has once again highlighted the importance of access to sufficient quantities of safe water and sanitation in public health. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, an early warning wastewater system has been proposed as a platform for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, and a potentially important public health strategy to combat the disease. This short communication on wastewater surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa highlights challenges, opportunities and alternatives taken into account the local context.
COVID-19 concomitant with infective endocarditis: A case report and review of management;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic and public health crisis across the world. With its high infectivity and rapid spread, the severity of the disease is escalating in certain populations, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. In developing countries, infective endocarditis remains a problem in patients with rheumatic heart disease. We report the case of a patient with a diagnosis of infective endocarditis concomitant with COVID-19, including the diagnosis, management, and main outcomes.
Comparison of molecular testing strategies for COVID-19 control: a mathematical modelling study;WHO has called for increased testing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but countries have taken different approaches and the effectiveness of alternative strategies is unknown. We aimed to investigate the potential impact of different testing and isolation strategies on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Plausible mechanisms of Niclosamide as an antiviral agent against COVID-19;Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused 18 440 deaths world wide as of 25 March 2020 and posing a serious threat to public health. There is a need, therefore, for effective therapeutic strategies to cure this disease. However, high attrition rates, substantial costs and slow pace are the major limitations of novel drug discovery. Drug repurposing, by employing ‘old’ drugs to treat ‘new’ diseases is an attractive approach in drug discovery. Niclosamide (NIC) is an approved anti-helminthic drug with diverse antiviral mechanisms. In this work we hypothesize, the potential antiviral mechanisms of NIC against COVID-19.
Mitochondrial-targeted ubiquinone: A potential treatment for COVID-19;Immune dysregulation characterized by T cell exhaustion and high level of inflammatory cytokines is associated with severe COVID-19. Figuring out the early event of immune dysregulation would provide a potential treatment for COVID-19. Recent evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction participates in the development of COVID-19 and may be responsible for the dysregulated immune response. Mitochondrial-targeted ubiquinone (MitoQ), a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, shows beneficial effects on various diseases through improving mitochondrial dysfunction. We hypothesize that MitoQ could act as a potential treatment in COVID-19. MitoQ may alleviate cytokine storm and restore the function of exhausted T cells in COVID-19 patients through improving mitochondrial dysfunction. In this article, we provide evidence to support the use of MitoQ as a potential treatment or adjunct therapy in the context of COVID-19.
Unique fibrinogen-binding motifs in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS CoV-2: Potential implications in host-pathogen interactions;Novel Coronavirus (SARS CoV-2), the etiological agent for the highly contagious Corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has threatened global health and economy infecting around 5.8 million people and causing over 359,200 deaths (as of 28th May 2020, 
Surfactant-based prophylaxis and therapy against COVID-19: A possibility;Hand hygiene by washing with soap and water is recommended for the prevention of COVID-19 spread. Soaps and detergents are explained to act by damaging viral spike glycoproteins (peplomers) or by washing out the virus through entrapment in the micelles. Technically, soaps come under a functional category of molecules known as surfactants. Surfactants are widely used in pharmaceutical formulations as excipients. We wonder why surfactants are still not tried for prophylaxis or therapy against COVID-19? That too when many of them have proven antiviral properties. Moreover, lung surfactants have already shown benefits in respiratory viral infections. Therefore, we postulate that surfactant-based prophylaxis and therapy would be promising. We believe that our hypothesis would stimulate debate or new research exploring the possibility of surfactant-based prophylaxis and therapy against COVID-19. The success of a surfactant-based technique would save the world from any such pandemic in the future too.
Air pollution and temperature are associated with increased COVID-19 incidence: A time series study;Although COVID-19 is known to be caused by human-to-human transmission, it remains largely unclear whether ambient air pollutants and meteorological parameters could promote its transmission.
Prospective vaccination of COVID-19 using shRNA-plasmid-LDH nanoconjugate;COVID-19 is the pandemic outbreak that is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus from December, 2019. Human race do not know the curative measure of this devastating disease. In today’s era of nanotechnology, it may use its knowledge to develop molecular vaccine to combat this disease. In this article we are intended to propose a hypothesis on the development of a vaccine that is molecular in nature to work against COVID-19. The nanoconjugate may comprise with the inorganic nanoparticle layered double hydroxide intercalated with shRNA-plasmid that have a sequence targeting towards the viral genome or viral mRNA. This nanoconjugate may be used as a nasal spray to deliver the shRNA-plasmid to the target site. The nanoconjugate will have several advantages such as they are biocompatible, they forms as stable knockdown to the target cells and they are stable in the nasal mucosa.
Social consequences of COVID-19 in a low resource setting in Sierra Leone, West Africa;Economical and psychological consequences of the lockdown in low-resource setting in rural Africa are unknown. We drafted a survey in order to address the social impact of COVID-19 lockdown on a rural village in Sierra Leone. The survey developed by the study group and translated in the local language, distributed to the householders of the village on April 13th and responses collected on April 14th, when Sierra Leone was on day 11 of lockdown. The questions aimed to assess in the community the following items: age group, main activities before lockdown, change in income and ability to feed the family during lockdown, anxiety during lockdown. 78 householders (100% of Bureh Town) replied. All, expect one, declared a 51−80% (19.2%) to 81−100% (79.4%) reduction of weekly income compared with the pre-lockdown period, declaring difficulties in providing food for the family members (82%), and anxiety (60%). Our analyses showed that people lost their jobs and have difficulties in providing food for their families.
Periodontal pockets: A potential reservoir for SARS-CoV-2?;Periodontal pockets are the major clinical manifestation of Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory oral disease affecting the teeth-supporting tissues and has high prevalence in the adult population. Periodontal pockets are ideal environments for subgingival bacterial biofilms, that interact with the supragingival oral cavity, mucosal tissues of the pocket and a peripheral circulatory system. Periodontal pockets have been found to harbor viral species such as the Herpes simplex viruses’ family. Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 has gained major interest of the scientific/medical community as it caused a global pandemic (Covid-19) and paralyzed the globe with high figures of infected people worldwide. This virus behavior is still partially understood, and by analyzing some of its features we hypothesized that periodontal pocket could be a favorable anatomical niche for the virus and thus acting as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2.
COVID-19 faecal-oral transmission: Are we asking the right questions?;Detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in stools and sewage has recently been reported, raising the hypothesis of faecal-oral transmission. If confirmed, this could have far-reaching consequences for public health and for pandemic control strategies. In this paper, we argue that a comprehensive and more nuanced analysis is required to test this hypothesis, taking into consideration both environmental dynamics and the persistence of viral infectivity. First, we examine the evidence regarding the presence of the virus in stools and sewage. Then we discuss the current framework of disease transmission through water and excreta and how the transmission of a respiratory disease fits into it. Against this background, we propose a framework to test the faecal-oral hypothesis, unpacking the different environmental routes from faeces to the mouth of a susceptible person. This framework should not be seen as a confirmation of the hypothesis but rather as an expanded view of its complexities, which could help shaping an agenda for research into a number of unanswered questions. Finally, the paper briefly discusses practical implications, based on current knowledge, for containment of the pandemic.
‘The Double-Edged Sword’ – An hypothesis for Covid-19-induced salivary biomarkers;Utilising biomarkers for COVID-19 diagnosis, prediction of treatment response and overall prognostication have been investigated recently. However, these ventures have only considered the use of blood-based molecular markers. Saliva is another biofluid that warrants being applied in similar fashion with major advantages that centres on its non-invasive and repeatable collection as well as cost-efficiency. To this end, this article presents a hypothesis for the sources of biomarkers useful clinically for COVID-19 disease outcome estimation and identify the likely implications of their detection in saliva.
Could Aquaporin Modulators Be Employed As Prospective Drugs For COVID- 19 Related Pulmonary Comorbidity?;Covid-19 initially an epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has turned out to be a life- threatening global pandemic with increased morbidity and mortality. The presence of cytokine storm has been linked with the pathogenesis of severe lung injury as evinced in Covid-19. Aquaporins (AQPs) are molecular water channels, facilitating water transport across the cell membrane in response to osmotic gradients. Impairment in alveolar fluid clearance due to altered functional expression of respiratory AQPs highlight their pathophysiological significance in pulmonary edema associated respiratory illness. Therefore, we hypothesize that targeted modulation of AQPs in lungs in the intervening period of time, could diminish the dreadful effects of inflammation- induced comorbidity in Covid-19.
COVID-19: How to make between-country comparisons;Different countries have adopted different containment and testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2. The difference in testing makes it difficult to compare the effect of different containment strategies. This study proposes methods to allow a direct comparison and presents the results.
SARS-CoV-2 infection pathogenesis is related to oxidative stress as a response to aggression;Since the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, a great effort has been made to understand this serious disease. Thousands of studies are being devoted to understanding its epidemiology, its molecular characteristics, its mechanisms, and the clinical evolution of this viral infection. However, little has been published on its pathogenesis and the host response mechanisms in the progress of the disease. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis based on strong scientific documentation, associating oxidative stress with changes found in patients with COVID-19, such as its participation in the amplification and perpetuation of the cytokine storm, coagulopathy, and cell hypoxia. Finally, we suggest a therapeutic strategy to reduce oxidative stress using antioxidants, NF-κB inhibitors, Nrf2 activators, and iron complexing agents. We believe that this hypothesis can guide new studies and therapeutic strategies on this topic.
;Periodontal disease (PD) comprises a group of diseases involving inflammatory aspects of the host and dysbiotic events that affect periodontal tissues and could have systemic implications. Diverse factors and comorbidities have been closely associated with PD such as diabetes, obesity, aging, hypertension, and so on
CORTICOSTEROIDS IN THE TREATMENT OF SEVERE COVID-19 LUNG DISEASE: THE PULMONOLOGY PERSPECTIVE FROM THE FIRST UNITED STATES EPICENTER;The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has introduced the medical community to a lung disease heretofore unknown to most clinicians. In much of the discourse about COVID-19 lung disease, the more familiar clinical entity of ARDS has been used as the guiding paradigm. Reflecting on studies in ARDS, particularly that due to influenza, and on data from the SARS-CoV and MERS epidemics, many authorities, including within the discipline of infectious diseases, were initially passionate in their opposition to the use of corticosteroids for lung involvement in COVID-19. The voice of the pulmonology community—the community of lung experts—has continued to be among the quietest in this conversation. Herein we offer our perspective as academic pulmonologists who encountered COVID-19 in its first United States epicenter of New York City. We encourage a conceptual separation between early COVID-19 lung involvement and ARDS. We draw on history with other immune cell-mediated lung diseases, on insights from the SARS-CoV experience, and on frontline observations in an attempt to allay the skepticism towards corticosteroids in COVID-19 lung disease that is likely to persist even as favorable study results emerge.
COVIDiagnosis-Net: Deep Bayes-SqueezeNet based diagnosis of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from X-ray images;The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has a tremendous impact on global health and the daily life of people still living in more than two hundred countries. The crucial action to gain the force in the fight of COVID-19 is to have powerful monitoring of the site forming infected patients. Most of the initial tests rely on detecting the genetic material of the coronavirus, and they have a poor detection rate with the time-consuming operation. In the ongoing process, radiological imaging is also preferred where chest X-rays are highlighted in the diagnosis. Early studies express the patients with an abnormality in chest X-rays pointing to the presence of the COVID-19. On this motivation, there are several studies cover the deep learning-based solutions to detect the COVID-19 using chest X-rays. A part of the existing studies use non-public datasets, others perform on complicated Artificial Intelligent (AI) structures. In our study, we demonstrate an AI-based structure to outperform the existing studies. The SqueezeNet that comes forward with its light network design is tuned for the COVID-19 diagnosis with Bayesian optimization additive. Fine-tuned hyperparameters and augmented dataset make the proposed network perform much better than existing network designs and to obtain a higher COVID-19 diagnosis accuracy.
Dynamic changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in adult patients with COVID-19;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread widely. The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamic changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in adult patients with COVID-19.
Adsorptive granulocyte and monocyte apheresis: A potentially relevant therapeutic option for COVID-19;The overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines and subsequent thromboembolism are major problems of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Adsorptive granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA), used for ulcerative colitis, is an extracorporeal therapy designed to remove activated myeloid lineage cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that GMA decreases proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophil–platelet aggregates. The effect of GMA on COVID-19 in a patient with ulcerative colitis was recently reported. The modes of action of GMA together with the findings of this case report indicate that GMA could be a relevant treatment option for COVID-19.
Coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy;This study aimed to compare clinical courses and outcomes between pregnant and reproductive-aged non-pregnant women with COVID-19, and to assess the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 in pregnancy.
Low Incidence and Mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in Southern Europe. Proposal of a hypothesis for Arthropod borne Herd immunity;SARS-CoV-2 incidence and mortality in Europe have shown wide variation. Northern Italy in particular the Lombardy region, north-eastern French regions, Switzerland and Belgium were amongst the hardest hit, while the central and southern Italian regions, all the Balkan countries from Slovenia to Greece and the Islands of Malta and Cyprus had much fewer cases and deaths per capita, and deaths per number of cases. Differences in public health measures, and health care delivery, in the author’s opinion, can only partly explain the difference. The geographical distribution of Phlebotomus sand-flies and the relative distribution of arthropod borne diseases Leishmaniasis and Phlebovirus infections especially the Sicilian Sandfly fever group corresponds to most areas of low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. A hypothesis is proposed whereby repeated arthropod or sandfly vector infection of humans by novel viruses of zoonotic origins carrying bat or mammalian RNA/DNA, such as phleboviruses may have resulted in the development of an effective evolutionary immune response to most novel zoonotic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 by means of survival of the fittest possibly over many generations. This process probably ran in parallel and concurrent with the progressive evolution of novel coronaviruses which spread from one mammalian species to another. Other possible, but less likely mechanisms for the role of sandfly meals within a much shorter time frame may have led to, (i) previous exposure and infection of humans with the SARS-Cov-2 virus itself, or a closely related corona virus in the previous decades, or (ii) exposure of human populations to parts coronavirus protein namely either S or more likely N protein carried mechanically by arthropods, but without clinical disease causing direct immunity or (iii) by causing infection with other arthropod borne viruses which could carry bat DNA/RNA and have similar functional proteins resulting in an immediate cross-reactive immune response rather than by natural selection. The Evidence possibly supporting or disputing this hypothesis is reviewed, however the major problem with the hypothesis is that to date no coronavirus has ever been isolated from arthropods. Such a hypothesis can only be supported by research investigating the possible biological relationship of arthropods and coronaviruses where paradoxically they may be promoting immunity rather than disease.
Ibuprofen, a traditional drug that may impact the course of COVID-19 new effective formulation in nebulizable solution;The traditional formulation of ibuprofen is poorly soluble in water, so the administered dose must be 10 times higher than the dose required for a therapeutic effect. The development of a hydrosoluble form of ibuprofen can be a strategy to reach a high concentration in the lungs by using modern inhalation devices. Therefore, the development of an inhalable formulation with high bioavailability in the lungs was the leitmotiv of our investigation. The hypertonic ibuprofen solution to be nebulized (NIH) presents great relevant characteristics: bactericidal, virucidal, mucolytic and has a known anti-inflammatory property. Bactericidal and virucidal effects are related to the physico-chemical properties of Na-ibuprofenate as an amphipathic molecule. It has the capability to insert into the bilayer membranes destabilizing the structure, altering its biological properties and avoiding the duplication or infection. Our preliminary results indicate that the presence of this high ionic strength solution reduces 10 times the amount of ibuprofen necessary to kill bacteria, but also the time to kill 1x10
Paromomycin: A potential dual targeted drug effectively inhibits both spike (S1) and main protease of COVID-19;With the increasing number of people suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is a dire need to look for effective remedies against this pandemic. Drug repurposing seems to be the solution for the current situation.
Safe hospital preparedness in the era of COVID-19: The Swiss cheese model;Since it first emerged in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly worldwide. During the pandemic of an emerging infectious disease, it is very important to prevent nosocomial outbreaks and operate hospitals safely to maintain their functions. In this article, we present the strategies for safe hospital operations based on the experiences of the Republic of Korea early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Each hospital should maintain multiple layers of defenses to prevent even small cracks in the hospital’s quarantine system.
Histopathology and ultrastructural findings of fatal COVID-19 infections in Washington State: a case series;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of an ongoing pandemic, with increasing deaths worldwide. To date, documentation of the histopathological features in fatal cases of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has been scarce due to sparse autopsy performance and incomplete organ sampling. We aimed to provide a clinicopathological report of severe COVID-19 cases by documenting histopathological changes and evidence of SARS-CoV-2 tissue tropism.
Is copper beneficial for COVID-19 patients?;Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for both pathogens and the hosts during viral infection. Cu is involved in the functions of critical immune cells such as T helper cells, B cells, neutrophils natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages. These blood cells are involved in the killing of infectious microbes, in cell-mediated immunity and the production of specific antibodies against the pathogens. Cu-deficient humans show an exceptional susceptibility to infections due to the decreased number and function of these blood cells. Besides, Cu can kill several infectious viruses such as bronchitis virus, poliovirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1), other enveloped or nonenveloped, single- or double-stranded DNA and RNA viruses. Moreover, Cu has the potent capacity of contact killing of several viruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2. Since the current outbreak of the COVID-19 continues to develop, and there is no vaccine or drugs are currently available, the critical option is now to make the immune system competent to fight against the SARS‐CoV‐2. Based on available data, we hypothesize that enrichment of plasma copper levels will boost both the innate and adaptive immunity in people. Moreover, owing to its potent antiviral activities, Cu may also act as a preventive and therapeutic regime against COVID-19.
Assessing the relationship between surface levels of PM2.5 and PM10 particulate matter impact on COVID-19 in Milan, Italy;The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly pathogenic, transmittable and invasive pneumococcal disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in December 2019 and January 2020 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China and fast spread later on the middle of February 2020 in the Northern part of Italy and Europe.
COVID-19 outbreak: Migration, effects on society, global environment and prevention;The COVID-19 pandemic is considered as the most crucial global health calamity of the century and the greatest challenge that the humankind faced since the 2nd World War. In December 2019, a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China and was named by the World Health Organization as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). A new class of corona virus, known as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has been found to be responsible for occurrence of this disease. As far as the history of human civilization is concerned there are instances of severe outbreaks of diseases caused by a number of viruses. According to the report of the World Health Organization (WHO as of April 18 2020), the current outbreak of COVID-19, has affected over 2164111 people and killed more than 146,198 people in more than 200 countries throughout the world. Till now there is no report of any clinically approved antiviral drugs or vaccines that are effective against COVID-19. It has rapidly spread around the world, posing enormous health, economic, environmental and social challenges to the entire human population. The coronavirus outbreak is severely disrupting the global economy. Almost all the nations are struggling to slow down the transmission of the disease by testing & treating patients, quarantining suspected persons through contact tracing, restricting large gatherings, maintaining complete or partial lock down etc. This paper describes the impact of COVID-19 on society and global environment, and the possible ways in which the disease can be controlled has also been discussed therein.
Usefulness of bronchoalveolar lavage in the management of patients presenting with lung infiltrates and suspect COVID-19-associated pneumonia: A case report;To report a clinical case of a patient with a compatible HRCT scan and two negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA upper respiratory tract specimens but with a confirmed viral infection by BAL (19 days after symptom onset).
On-site analysis of COVID-19 on the surfaces in wards;SARS-Cov-2 has erupted across the globe, and confirmed cases of COVID-19 pose a high infection risk. Infected patients typically receive their treatment in specific isolation wards, where they are confined for at least 14 days. The virus may contaminate any surface of the room, especially frequently touched surfaces. Therefore, surface contamination in wards should be monitored for disease control and hygiene purposes. Herein, surface contamination in the ward was detected on-site using an RNA extraction-free rapid method. The whole detection process, from surface sample collection to readout of the detection results, was finished within 45 min. The nucleic acid extraction-free method requires minimal labor. More importantly, the tests were performed on-site and the results were obtained almost in real-time. The test confirmed that 31 patients contaminated seven individual sites. Among the sampled surfaces, the electrocardiogram fingertip presented a 72.7% positive rate, indicating that this surface is an important hygiene site. Meanwhile, the bedrails showed the highest correlation with other surfaces, so should be detected daily. Another surface with high contamination risk was the door handle in the bathroom. To our knowledge, we present the first on-site analysis of COVID-19 surface contamination in wards. The results and applied technique provide a potential further reference for disease control and hygiene suggestions.
;Most COVID-19 infected individuals present with mild flu-like symptoms
Successful recovery of severe COVID-19 with cytokine storm treating with extracorporeal blood purification;COVID-19 associated cytokine storm could rapidly induce ARDS, and the patients would require mechanical ventilation. However, the prognosis was not that optimistic. The outcome might be changed if the timely intervention of EBP was performed. We present a case of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection who recovered from a cytokine storm.
Temporal profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks. Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.
Epidemiological, clinical characteristics of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with abnormal imaging findings;To investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with abnormal imaging findings.
Effects of a major deletion in the SARS-CoV-2 genome on the severity of infection and the inflammatory response: an observational cohort study;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with a 382-nucleotide deletion (∆382) in the open reading frame 8 (ORF8) region of the genome have been detected in Singapore and other countries. We investigated the effect of this deletion on the clinical features of infection.
The temperature and regional climate effects on communitarian COVID-19 contagion in Mexico throughout phase 1;Due to the close relationship between the incidence of infectious diseases by epidemics and environmental conditions, this research explores the temperature, evaporation, precipitation and regional climate effects on the local transmission of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 inside 31 states and capital of Mexico since February 29 (national onset) to March 31, 2020. Statistical analysis was conducted to explore the association between the daily local COVID-19 confirmed positive cases (LCPC) and both climate characteristics and the daily weather reported by the regional meteorological stations. In this work, the local transmission ratio (LTR) was calculated with the regional LCPC divided by the number of the effective contagion days since regional onset in each state. The results showed a negative association between temperature (mean, max and min) and climate classification with both LCPC and LTR variables. The precipitation associated positively with LCPC and LTR. The associations between the climate classification with LCPC and LTR are statistically significant. The tropical climate (mean temperature around 25.95 °C and mean precipitation around 8.74 mm) delayed the regional onset. However, the regional onset in dry climates emerged earlier as consequence of the lower temperatures and higher precipitations (20.57 °C and 20.87 mm respectively) than the observed in the tropical climate. The fastest regional onsets were observed in tempered climates in states where the lowest temperatures and lowest precipitations were registered (19.65 °C and 8.48 mm respectively). Meteorological factors influenced the trend on the regional outbreaks in Mexican's states likely by the host predisposition and susceptibility during the cold winter season. In Mexico, the climate characteristics played a crucial role on the local infection during the phase 1 being the tempered regions (as Michoacán, Jalisco, Puebla, etc.) more vulnerable than the dry (as Chihuahua, Durango or Zacatecas, etc.) or tropical areas (as Colima, Campeche, Morelos etc.).
COVID-19 in Italy: Considerations on official data;"COVID-19 represents a major public health issue in Italy; estimating the size of the outbreak could direct public health policies and inform us of the extent of the reorganization needed in the healthcare system, the efficacy of quarantine measures, and eventually on the achievement of herd immunity. To chart the real extent of COVID-19 infection in Italy official data need to be interpreted, considering various aspects such as the ""suspected-case"" definition that changed during recent months, the management of asymptomatic and untested symptomatic cases, the system for reporting deaths, and short-term fluctuations. All these aspects should be considered when reflecting on the meaning of the official COVID-19 figures in Italy. Regionalization of the healthcare system and fragmentation of data represent real challenges in the management of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. The authors’ opinion is that transparent and accurate reporting could guide policy-making and help reorganize health services."
Active case finding with case management: the key to tackling the COVID-19 pandemic;COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020, the first non-influenza pandemic, affecting more than 200 countries and areas, with more than 5·9 million cases by May 31, 2020. Countries have developed strategies to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic that fit their epidemiological situations, capacities, and values. We describe China's strategies for prevention and control of COVID-19 (containment and suppression) and their application, from the perspective of the COVID-19 experience to date in China. Although China has contained severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and nearly stopped indigenous transmission, a strong suppression effort must continue to prevent re-establishment of community transmission from importation-related cases. We believe that case finding and management, with identification and quarantine of close contacts, are vitally important containment measures and are essential in China's pathway forward. We describe the next steps planned in China that follow the containment effort. We believe that sharing countries' experiences will help the global community manage the COVID-19 pandemic by identifying what works in the struggle against SARS-CoV-2.
Review of adverse cutaneous reactions of pharmacologic interventions for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a guide for the dermatologist;The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a wide variety of cutaneous manifestations. While new skin manifestations caused by COVID-19 are continuously being described, other cutaneous entities should also be considered in the differential diagnosis, including adverse cutaneous reactions to drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 infections. The aim of this review is to provide dermatologists with an overview of the cutaneous side effects associated with the most frequently prescribed drugs in patients with COVID-19. The skin reactions of antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin +/- interferon, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir and darunavir) and treatments for complications (imatinib, tocilizumab, anakinra, immunoglobulins, corticosteroids, colchicine and low molecular weight heparins) are analyzed. Information regarding possible skin reactions, their frequency, management and key points for differential diagnosis are presented.
Zinc Iodide in combination with Dimethyl Sulfoxide for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections;Zinc Iodide and Dimethyl Sulfoxide compositions are proposed as therapeutic agents to treat and prevent chronic and acute viral infections including SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The therapeutic combinations have a wide range of virucidal effects on DNA and RNA containing viruses. The combinations also exhibit anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating, antifibrotic, antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidative effects. Given the fact that Zinc Iodide has been used as an oral antiseptic agent and DMSO has been already proven as a safe pharmaceutical solvent and therapeutic agent, we hypothesize that the combination of these two agents can be applied as an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment for SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infection. The therapeutic compound can be applied as both etiological and pathogenesis therapy and used as an effective and safe antiseptic (disinfectant) for human and animals as well.
Hypothesis for the management and treatment of the COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome and lung injury using mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a member of the coronaviridae that causes respiratory disorders. After infection, large amounts of inflammatory cytokines are secreted, known as the cytokine storm. These cytokines can cause pulmonary damage induced by inflammation resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death.
A potential role for cyclophosphamide in the mitigation of acute respiratory distress syndrome among patients with SARS-CoV-2;While humanity struggles to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, it is imperative that effective and affordable therapeutic strategies be evolved. Since a majority of the SARS-CoV-2 deaths are due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a strategy to mitigate the same could save countless lives. Since SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS has a strong immunological component, many investigators are utilizing monoclonal antibodies against IL-6, TNF-alpha and CCR5. However, targeting a single cytokine with an expensive monoclonal antibody could be a less pragmatic approach. We propose the use of cyclophosphamide as an immunomodulator, given its proven role in various settings including autoimmune diseases, and in the post-haploidentical stem cell transplant. Cyclophosphamide could deplete cytotoxic and effector T cell populations while relatively sparing the regulatory T cells (Tregs). Cyclophosphamide could tip the balance away from the overtly pro-inflammatory and could be a less expensive and effective alternative to the currently investigated monoclonal antibodies.
Environmental side effects of the injudicious use of antimicrobials in the era of COVID-19;Use of antimicrobials in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is on the rise. The increased use of antimicrobials can have serious consequences on the environment. Antibiotics have had a reasonable role in bacterial co-infections with regards to the management of COVID-19. However, recent evidences suggest that there has been injudicious prescription of antimicrobials. Moreover, a large number of people are self-medicating with antibiotics in a misguided attempt to protect themselves from the virus. This practice is especially prevalent in developing communities. Although common soaps are effective at inactivating enveloped viruses, such as the SARS-CoV-2, use of antibacterial products bearing biocides has increased during this pandemic. Current wastewater treatment techniques are unable to offer complete elimination of antibacterial biocides. These compounds can then accumulate in different environmental compartments thus, disrupting the functioning of native microbes. These microbes are involved in the biogeochemical cycling of elements and environmental remediation. In addition, the presence of antimicrobial elements in the environment can stimulate antimicrobial resistance. Concrete actions are needed to address this issue. Development of an antimicrobial policy specific for COVID-19 is urgently needed. Investments into improving wastewater infrastructure as well as public awareness is crucial. Moreover, global monitoring programs and multidisciplinary collaborations are required to understand the environmental impact of this pandemics.
What would Sérgio Ferreira say to your physician in this war against COVID-19: How about kallikrein/kinin system?;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with fast spreading all over the world caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus which can culminate in a severe acute respiratory syndrome by the injury caused in the lungs. However, other organs can be also damaged. SARS-CoV-2 enter into the host cells using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as receptor, like its ancestor SARS-CoV. ACE2 is then downregulated in lung tissues with augmented serum levels of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Interestingly, ACE2
Asymptomatic patients as a source of COVID-19 infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis;Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by an unpredictable disease course, ranging from asymptomatic to severe, life-threatening infections. Asymptomatic COVID-19 infections have been described, and the aim of this systematic review was to summarise their presentation forms.
Intra-abdominal hypertension as a trigger of “gut failure” in SARS-CoV-2 infection: Effect of open abdomen (OA) and negative pressure therapy (NPT) on respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) function;COVID-19 gastrointestinal manifestations could be attributed to SARS-CoV-2-induced small vessel thrombosis. OA with NPT treatment may have a role in optimization of bowel microcirculation and in the reduction of the endothelial and the systemic cytokine-related damage, improving also respiratory function.
;Factors associated with negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in hospitalized patients have not yet been systematically determined. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, China. Both univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify independent factors for time to viral RNA negative conversion. Data on patients with re-detectable viral RNA after showing negative on RT-PCR test (intermittent negative status) were also analyzed. A total of 59 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were included in this study, with a median duration of 1 (interquartile range, IQR: 0–2) day from symptom onset to hospital admission. Median communicable period (from first day of positive nucleic acid test to first day of consecutive negative results) was 14 (IQR: 10–18) days, and 7 (IQR: 6–10) days for 10 patients with intermittent negative results. Age older than 45 years (hazard ratio, HR: 0.378
Could autism spectrum disorders be a risk factor for COVID-19?;The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemia is infecting millions of people and some studies relate conditions that might increase the risk of developing a fatal course for the disease, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and obesity. In COVID-19 physiopathology, one of the main inflammation mechanisms is the “cytokine storm”, causing a pro-inflammatory state, related to cardiac and pulmonary damage. There is also a less effective role of lymphocyte B and T in the humoral immunity due to the reduction of their proliferative response. The physiopathology of ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) involves several modifications at the genetic and at the immune level, such as the increase of inflammatory cytokines and abnormal immune response in several levels. We hypothesize that ASD could be a risk-factor as the other conditions are.
;To date, no country has reached a natural COVID-19 epidemic peak and observed peaks essentially reflect the effectiveness of ‘lockdown’ measures. The major challenge is finding a responsible way out of ‘lockdown’, given that SARS- CoV-2 is now an established global pathogen. Acknowledging limitations in our knowledge regarding the sufficiency and durability of immune responses following natural SARS Cov-2 infection, we discuss three pathways to ‘community protection’. Uncontrolled epidemic spread (route 1
Transmission onset distribution of COVID-19;The distribution of the transmission onset of COVID-19 relative to the symptom onset is a key parameter for infection control. It is often not easy to study the transmission onset time, as is difficult to know who infected whom exactly when.
SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and impact on female genital tract: An untested hypothesis;COVID pandemic consists one of the most challenging medical realities. Apart from affecting respiratory system, current evidence has demonstrated multiorgan manifestations that SARS-Cov-2 infection may actually have. However, one of the medical hypotheses not yet thoroughly tested is the impact on female reproductive system and more specifically cervix. No large observational studies have been performed to test presence of SARS-Cov-2 in cervical samples, while potential correlation and impact on HPV infection has not yet been examined. In this context, our research team has already planned to begin a prospective observational study regarding detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in cervical cytology. The collected specimen will be analyzed for the presence of COVID-19 genetic material and in case of positive results, HPV typing will be performed as well in order to detect potential correlations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and HPV-infection. We would therefore like to launch our idea to control for SARS-CoV-2 infection in cervical specimen as well as examine potential correlation with HPV infection. Potential scientific proof of such hypothesis would change much regarding follow-up of HPV-positive patients while also triggering further research regarding aitiopathogenetic pathways of COVID. Communication of such a medical hypothesis could potentially motivate colleagues worldwide to expand their interest also on the research of SARS-CoV-2 cervical infection, in an effort to optimize our level of knowledge towards this new threatening and unknown reality of SARS-CoV-2.
Clinical characteristics of critically ill patients co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the influenza virus in Wuhan, China;To delineate the clinical characteristics of critically ill COVID-19 patients co-infected with influenza.
Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection and the risk for cancer;The current SARS-CoV-2 has put significant strain on healthcare services worldwide due to acute COVID-19. However, the potential long-term effects of this infection haven’t been extensively discussed.
A spatio-temporal analysis for exploring the effect of temperature on COVID-19 early evolution in Spain;The new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, was reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This new pathogen has spread rapidly around more than 200 countries, in which Spain has one of the world's highest mortality rates so far. Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that weather conditions may affect the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases. However, some contradictory studies have also been reported in the same research line. In addition, many of these studies have been performed considering only meteorological factors, which can limit the reliability of the results. Herein, we report a spatio-temporal analysis for exploring the effect of daily temperature (mean, minimum and maximum) on the accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in the provinces of Spain. Non-meteorological factors such as population density, population by age, number of travellers and number of companies have also been considered for the analysis. No evidence suggesting a reduction in COVID-19 cases at warmer mean, minimum and maximum temperatures has been found. Nevertheless, these results need to be interpreted cautiously given the existing uncertainty about COVID-19 data, and should not be extrapolated to temperature ranges other than those analysed here for the early evolution period.
Acute onset olfactory/taste disorders are associated with a high viral burden in mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections;This study investigated, using cycle threshold (Ct) qPCR values, the association between symptoms and viral clearance in 57 patients with asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with olfactory/taste disorders (OTDs) exhibited lower qPCR Ct values and longer time to negative qPCR than those without OTDs, suggesting an association between OTDs and high viral burden.
Exercise as medicine for COVID-19: on PPAR with emerging pharmacotherapy;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may have a metabolic origin given strong links with risk factors such as lipids and glucose and co-morbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein mediates viral cellular entry via the ACE2 receptor. The cytoplasmic tail of this spike protein is heavily palmitoylated. Emerging studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 alters lipid metabolism in the lung epithelial cells by modulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), possibly contributing to lipotoxicity, inflammation and untoward respiratory effects. Disruption of this process may affect palmitoylation of SARS-CoV spike protein and thus infectivity and viral assembly. COVID-19 is also increasingly being recognized as a vascular disease, with several studies noting prominent systemic endothelial dysfunction. The pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction may also be linked to COVID-19-mediated metabolic and inflammatory effects. Herein, exercise will be compared to fenofibrate as a possible therapeutic strategy to bolster resilience against (and help manage recovery from) COVID-19. This paper will explore the hypothesis that exercise may be a useful adjuvant in a setting of COVID-19 management/rehabilitation due to its effects on PPARα and vascular endothelial function.
When the fourth water and digital revolution encountered COVID-19;The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is, undeniably, a substantial shock to our civilization which has revealed the value of public services that relate to public health. Ensuring a safe and reliable water supply and maintaining water sanitation has become ever more critical during the pandemic. For this reason, researchers and practitioners have promptly investigated the impact associated with the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on water treatment processes, focusing specifically on water disinfection. However, the COVID-19 pandemic impacts multiple aspects of the urban water sector besides those related to the engineering processes, including sanitary, economic, and social consequences which can have significant effects in the near future. Furthermore, this outbreak appears at a time when the water sector was already experiencing a fourth revolution, transitioning toward the digitalisation of the sector, which redefines the Water-Human-Data Nexus. In this contribution, a product of collaboration between academics and practitioners from water utilities, we delve into the multiple impacts that the pandemic is currently causing and their possible consequences in the future. We show how the digitalisation of the water sector can provide useful approaches and tools to help address the impact of the pandemic. We expect this discussion to contribute not only to current challenges, but also to the conceptualization of new projects and the broader task of ameliorating climate change.
Viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers and presymptomatic patients;From a total of 71 laboratory-confirmed cases, three presymptomatic patients and 10 patients with entirely asymptomatic infections were identified. In two of the three incubation period patients, the viral titer in the presymptomatic period was very high (Ct value < 20). The median number of days to first negative RT-PCR in the asymptomatic carriers was 4.5 (range 2.5–9), and all asymptomatic carriers reached a first RT-PCR Ct > 35 within 14 days after diagnosis. Patients who have COVID-19 may already be infectious before there are symptoms, and 14 days of isolation after diagnosis may be sufficient in entirely asymptomatic cases.
Effect of a Previous History of Antiretroviral Treatment on Clinical Picture of Patients with Co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV: A Preliminary Study;We aimed to explore the effect of antiretroviral treatment (ART) history on clinical characteristics of patients with co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV.
The pathogenesis and treatment of the `Cytokine Storm' in COVID-19;Cytokine storm is a general term applied to maladaptive cytokine release in response to infection and other stimuli. The pathogenesis is complex but includes loss of regulatory control of proinflammatory cytokine production, both at local and systemic levels. The disease progresses rapidly, and the mortality is high. Some evidence shows that, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, severe deterioration in some patients has been closely associated with dysregulated and excessive cytokine release. This article reviews what we know of the mechanism and treatment strategies of the COVID-19 virus-induced inflammatory storm in an attempt to provide some background to inform future guidance for clinical treatment.
Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to prioritize hospital admission of patients affected by COVID-19 in low-resource settings with hospital-bed shortage;To use Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to determine weights for eleven criteria in order to prioritize COVID-19 non-critical patients for admission to hospital in healthcare settings with limited resources.
Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via fecal-oral and aerosols–borne routes: Environmental dynamics and implications for wastewater management in underprivileged societies;The advent of novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its potential transmission via fecal-oral and aerosols-borne routes are upcoming challenges to understand the fate of the virus in the environment. In this short communication, we specifically looked at the possibilities of these transmission routes based on the available literature directly related to the SARS-CoV-2 as well as on the closer phylogenetic relatives such as SARS-CoV-1. The available data suggest that, in addition to human-to-human contact, the virus may spread via fecal-oral and aerosols-borne routes. Existing knowledge states that coronaviruses have low stability in the environment due to the natural action of oxidants that disrupt the viral envelope. Previous recommended dosage of chlorination has been found to be not sufficient to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in places where viral load is high such as hospitals and airports. Although there is no current evidence showing that coronaviruses can be transmitted through contaminated drinking water, there is a growing concern on the impact of the current pandemic wave on underprivileged societies because of their poor wastewater treatment infrastructures, overpopulation, and outbreak management strategies. More research is encouraged to trace the actual fate of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment and to develop/revise the disinfection strategies accordingly.
;Lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol have been previously used to treat acute respiratory syndrome- coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication in clinical practice
Unheralded Lower limb threatening ischemia in a COVID-19 patient;Acute thromboembolic events appear to be frequent in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We report a case of an intubated patient, who developed a threatening lower limb ischemia. Intra-arterial fibrinolysis and intravenous heparin infusion did not lead to complete recanalization of the tibial arteries, which were successfully treated by surgical embolectomy.
;Since December 2019, a respiratory pandemic named as coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by a new coronavirus named as SARS-CoV-2, has taken the world by storm. The symptoms are fever, malaise, and cough which resolve in a few days in most cases
Case report study of the first five COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir in France;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak worldwide. Data on treatment are scare and parallels have been made between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral with efficient in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Evidence of clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir is controversial. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical outcomes and virological monitoring of the first five COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France, for severe pneumonia related to SARS-CoV-2 and treated with remdesivir. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in blood plasma and the lower and upper respiratory tract. Among the five patients treated, two needed mechanical ventilation and one needed high-flow cannula oxygen. A significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract was observed in most cases, but two patients died with active SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lower respiratory tract. Plasma samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in only one patient. Remdesivir was interrupted before the initialy planned duration in four patients, two because of alanine aminotransferase elevations (3 to 5 normal range) and two because of renal failure requiring renal replacement. This case series of five COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit treatment for respiratory distress and treated with remdesivir, highlights the complexity of remdesivir use in such critically ill patients.
Coronavirus 2019-nCoV: A brief perspective from the front line;A novel coronavirus, designated as 2019-nCoV, hit the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late December 2019, and subsequently spread rapidly to all provinces of China and multiple countries. As of 0:00 am February 9, 2020, a total of 37,287 cases have been confirmed infection of 2019-nCoV in China mainland, and 302 cases have also been cumulatively reported from 24 countries. According to the latest data, a total of 813 deaths occurred in China mainland, with the mortality reaching approximately 2.2%. At present, there is no vaccine or specific drugs for the human coronavirus. Therefore, it is critical to understand the nature of the virus and its clinical characteristics, in order to respond to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Thus, the present study briefly but comprehensively summarizes the not much but timely reports on the 2019-nCoV.
Positive effects of COVID-19 control measures on influenza prevention;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now become a pandemic threat to the whole world. At the same time, influenza virus has been active, with influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 sharing the same transmission routes. This article aims to alert clinicians of the presence of co-infection with these two viruses and to describe the effect of the measures taken to fight COVID-19 on influenza prevention and control.
EMMPRIN/BASIGIN as a biological modulator of oral cancer and COVID-19 interaction: Novel propositions;Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), which is also called BASIGIN/CD147, is a cell surface glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and plays a significant role in intercellular recognition in immunology, cellular differentiation and development. Apart from ACE-2, recently EMMPRIN, has been regarded as a target for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) attachment and entry into the host cell. Since one of the routes of entry for the virus is the oral cavity, it becomes imperative to percept oral comorbidities such oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) in terms of EMMPRIN as a target for SARS-CoV-2. In the present paper, it is proposed that OSCC, by the virtue of upregulation of EMMPRIN expression, increases the susceptibility to coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In turn, COVID-19 in OSCC patients causes exhaustion of EMMPRIN receptor due to binding with ‘S’ receptor leading to a downregulation of related carcinogenesis events. We proposed that in the ACE-2 depleted situation in OSCC, EMMPRIN receptor might get high jacked by the COVID-19 virus for the entry into the host cells. Apart from the anti-monoclonal antibody, it is recommended to explore the use of grape seed and skin containing mouthwash as an adjunct, which could also have anti EMMPRIN effects in patients with OSCC and OPMDs.
Neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 and possible pathogenic mechanisms: Insights from other coronaviruses;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a global public health threat. Though the fear, anxiety, and stress related to COVID-19 have been studied in depth, the direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the central nervous system (CNS) remain elusive. Research related to the earlier coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks (like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS) shows the neurotropic nature of CoV and the plethora of neuropsychiatric effects that it can cause. Though the current health priorities in managing COVID-19 remain restricted to containment and targeting pulmonary symptoms, the potential acute and long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae of the infection can increase morbidity and worsen the quality of life. Emerging evidence shows neural spread of the novel coronavirus. Delirium, encephalopathy, olfactory disturbances, acute behavioral changes, headache and cerebrovascular accidents are its common neuropsychiatric complications. These are directly related to increase in peripheral immunological markers, severity of infection and case fatality rate. This narrative review synthesizes available evidence related to the neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19. Also, as SARS-CoV-2 shares structural and functional similarities with its earlier congeners, this article proposes possible long-term neuropsychological sequelae and pathogenic mechanisms for the same, based on research in the other coronavirus outbreaks.
HIV care in times of the COVID-19 crisis — Where are we now in Central and Eastern Europe?;The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has hit the European region disproportionately. Many HIV clinics share staff and logistics with infectious disease facilities, which are now on the frontline in tackling COVID-19. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of the current pandemic situation on HIV care and continuity of antiretroviral treatment (ART) supplies in CEE countries.
Is hesperidin essential for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 Infection?;SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 is representing the major global burden that implicated more than 4.7 million infected cases and 310 thousand deaths worldwide in less than 6 months. The prevalence of this pandemic disease is expected to rise every day. The challenge is to control its rapid spread meanwhile looking for a specific treatment to improve patient outcomes. Hesperidin is a classical herbal medicine used worldwide for a long time with an excellent safety profile. Hesperidin is a well-known herbal medication used as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Available shreds of evidence support the promising use of hesperidin in prophylaxis and treatment of COVID 19. Herein, we discuss the possible prophylactic and treatment mechanisms of hesperidin based on previous and recent findings. Hesperidin can block coronavirus from entering host cells through ACE2 receptors which can prevent the infection. Anti-viral activity of hesperidin might constitute a treatment option for COVID-19 through improving host cellular immunity against infection and its good anti-inflammatory activity may help in controlling cytokine storm. Hesperidin mixture with diosmin co-administrated with heparin protect against venous thromboembolism which may prevent disease progression. Based on that, hesperidin might be used as a meaningful prophylactic agent and a promising adjuvant treatment option against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Comparison of virus concentration methods for the RT-qPCR-based recovery of murine hepatitis virus, a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 from untreated wastewater;There is currently a clear benefit for many countries to utilize wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as part of ongoing measures to manage the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic. Since most wastewater virus concentration methods were developed and validated for nonenveloped viruses, it is imperative to determine the efficiency of the most commonly used methods for the enveloped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Municipal wastewater seeded with a human coronavirus (CoV) surrogate, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), was used to test the efficiency of seven wastewater virus concentration methods: (A–C) adsorption-extraction with three different pre-treatment options, (D–E) centrifugal filter device methods with two different devices, (F) polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) precipitation, and (G) ultracentrifugation. MHV was quantified by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the recovery efficiency was calculated for each method. The mean MHV recoveries ranged from 26.7 to 65.7%. The most efficient methods were adsorption-extraction methods with MgCl
Follow-up studies in COVID-19 recovered patients - is it mandatory?;The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an illness caused due to Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this outbreak a global health emergency and as on April 24, 2020, it has spread to 213 countries, with 25,91,015 confirmed cases and 742,855 cases have been recovered from COVID-19. In this dreadful situation our team has already published an article in the Science of the Total Environment, which elaborates the various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this situation, it is imperative to understand the possible outcome of COVID-19 recovered patients and determine if they have any other detrimental illnesses by longitudinal analysis to safeguard their life in future. It is necessary to follow-up these recovered patients and performs comprehensive assessments for detection and appropriate management towards their psychological, physical, and social realm. This urges us to suggest that it is highly important to provide counselling, moral support as well as a few recommended guidelines to the recovered patients and society to restore to normalcy. Epidemiological, clinical and immunological studies from COVID-19 recovered patients are particularly important to understand the disease and to prepare better for potential outbreaks in the future. Longitudinal studies on a larger cohort would help us to understand the in-depth prognosis as well as the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Also, follow-up studies will help us provide more information for the development of vaccines and drugs for these kinds of pandemics in the future. Hence, we recommend more studies are required to unravel the possible mechanism of COVID-19 infection and the after-effects of it to understand the characteristics of the virus and to develop the necessary precautionary measures to prevent it.
: A synchronized whole-of-world approach for COVID-19 mitigation;The COVID-19 pandemic can no longer be mitigated by a nationwide approach of individual nations alone. Given its scale and accelerating expansion, COVID-19 requires a coordinated and simultaneous Whole- of-World approach that galvanizes clear global leadership and solidarity from all governments of the world. Considering an ‘all hands-on deck’ concept, we present a comprehensive list of tools and entities responsible for enabling them, as well a conceptual framework to achieve the maximum impact. The list is drawn from pandemic mitigation tools developed in response to past outbreaks including influenza, coronaviruses, and Ebola, and includes tools to minimize transmission in various settings including person-to-person, crowd, funerals, travel, workplace, and events and gatherings including business, social and religious venues. Included are the roles of individuals, communities, government and other sectors such as school systems, health, institutions, and business. While individuals and communities have significant responsibilities to prevent person-to-person transmission, other entities can play a significant role to enable individuals and communities to make use of the tools. Historic and current data indicate the role of political will, whole-of-government approach, and the role of early introduction of mitigation measures. There is also an urgent need to further elucidate the immunologic mechanisms underlying the epidemiological characteristics such as the low disease burden among women, and the role of COVID-19 in inducing Kawasaki-like syndromes in children. Understanding the role of and development of anti-inflammatory strategies based on our understanding of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1, IL-6) is also critical. Similarly, the role of oxygen therapy as an anti-inflammatory strategy is evident and access to oxygen therapy should be prioritized to avoid the aggravation of COVID-19 infection. We highlight the need for global solidarity to share both mitigation commodities and infrastructure between countries. Given the global reach of COVID-19 and potential for repeat waves of outbreaks, we call on all countries and communities to act synergistically and emphasize the need for synchronized pan-global mitigation efforts to minimize everyone's risk, to maximize collaboration, and to commit to shared progress.
Antecedent Immunosuppressive Therapy for Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases in the Setting of a COVID-19 Outbreak;Finite clinical data and understanding of COVID-19 immunopathology has led to limited, opinion-based recommendations for management of immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID) patients on immunosuppressive (IS) therapeutics.
Airborne route and bad use of ventilation systems as non-negligible factors in SARS-CoV-2 transmission;The world is facing a pandemic of unseen proportions caused by a corona virus named SARS-CoV-2 with unprecedent worldwide measures being taken to tackle its contagion. Person-to-person transmission is accepted but WHO only considers aerosol transmission when procedures or support treatments that produce aerosol are performed. Transmission mechanisms are not fully understood and there is evidence for an airborne route to be considered, as the virus remains viable in aerosols for at least 3 h and that mask usage was the best intervention to prevent infection.
Are graphene and graphene-derived products capable of preventing COVID-19 infection?;The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This disease is a severe respiratory tract infection that spreading rapidly around the world. In this pandemic situation, the researchers' effort is to understand the targets of the virus, mechanism of their cause, and transmission from animal to human and vice-versa. Therefore, to support COVID-19 research and development, we have proposed approaches based on graphene and graphene-derived nanomaterials against COVID-19.
;The human coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic. Social distancing, hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment dominate the current fight against COVID-19. In developing countries, the need for clean water provision, sanitation and hygiene have only received limited attention. The current perspective examines the latest evidence, on the occurrence, persistence and faecal-oral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent for COVID-19. Evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 proliferate in the human gastrointestinal system, and is shed via faeces. SARS-CoV-2 can survive and remain viable for up to 6 to 9 days on surfaces. Recent wastewater-based epidemiological studies from several countries also detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw wastewaters. Shell disorder analysis show that SARS-CoV-2 has a rigid outer shell conferring resilience, and a low shell disorder conferring moderate potential for faecal-oral transmission. Taken together, these findings point to potential faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which may partly explain its rapid transmission. Three potential mechanisms may account for SARS-CoV-2 faecal-oral transmission: (1) untreated contaminated drinking water, (2) raw and poorly cooked marine and aquatic foods from contaminated sources, and also raw wastewater-based irrigation (e.g., salads) and aquaculture, and (3) vector-mediated transmission from faecal sources to foods, particularly those from open markets and street vending. SARS-CoV-2 faecal-oral transmission could be particularly high in developing countries due to several risk factors, including
SARS-CoV-2-related mortality in a rural Latin American population;A sudden increase in adult mortality associated with respiratory diseases was noticed in Atahualpa (a rural Ecuadorian village), coinciding with the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the region. From a total of 1,852 individuals aged ≥18 years, 40 deaths occurred between January and June, 2020. In addition, a seroprevalence survey showed that 45% of the adult population have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Verbal autopsies revealed SARS-CoV-2 as the most likely cause of death in 29 cases. The mean age of suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases was 76.9 ± 12.1 years, while that of those dying from unrelated causes was 60.3 ± 20.4 years (
Household transmission of SARS-CoV-2;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused an epidemic in China and many other countries. Many infected clusters have been found within familial households, but the data about secondary transmission among household contacts is limited.
The influence of ABO blood groups on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity: A molecular hypothesis based on carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions;The world is experiencing one of the most difficult moments in history with the COVID-19 pandemic, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a new type of coronavirus. Virus infectivity is mediated by the binding of Spike transmembrane glycoprotein to specific protein receptors present on cell host surface. Spike is a homotrimer that emerges from the virion, each monomer containing two subunits named S1 and S2, which are related to cell recognition and membrane fusion, respectively. S1 is subdivided in domains S1A (or NTD) and S1B (or RBD), with experimental and 
Severe immune thrombocytopenia in a critically ill COVID-19 patient;The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe and even fatal respiratory illness named COVID-19. Apart from respiratory failure, COVID-19 may be associated with various autoimmune complications. We present a case of a critically ill patient with COVID-19, who developed severe immune thrombocytopenia, which was successfully treated with a concomitant use of corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulins.
Cytochrome P450-mediated drug interactions in COVID-19 patients: Current findings and possible mechanisms;At the end of 2019, the entire world has witnessed the birth of a new member of coronavirus family in Wuhan, China. Ever since, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has swiftly invaded every corner on the planet. By the end of April 2020, almost 3.5 million cases have been reported worldwide, with a death toll of about 250,000 deaths. It is currently well-recognized that patient’s immune response plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This inflammatory element was evidenced by its elevated mediators that, in severe cases, reach their peak in a cytokine storm. Together with the reported markers of liver injury, such hyperinflammatory state may trigger significant derangements in hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolic machinery, and subsequent modulation of drug clearance that may result in unexpected therapeutic/toxic response. We hypothesize that COVID-19 patients are potentially vulnerable to a significant disease-drug interaction, and therefore, suitable dosing guidelines with therapeutic drug monitoring should be implemented to assure optimal clinical outcomes.
Impact of Tocilizumab on mortality and/or invasive mechanical ventilation requirement in a cohort of 206 COVID-19 patients;No therapy has proven to be effective yet to reduce mortality and/or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) requirement in COVID-19. Tocilizumab (TCZ) in patients with severe COVID-19 could be an effective treatment.
Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) with COVID-19: Insights from simultaneous familial Kawasaki Disease cases;Recently, an increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 patients with COVID-19 syndrome, which overlaps with Kawasaki Disease (KD), have been reported, supporting the suggestion that infection is one of the triggers of KD. We summarized the reports of simultaneous familial KD cases to better understand the etiopathogenesis of both KD and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) related to COVID-19. Here we discuss the etiology of these syndromes from the point of view of infection and genetic susceptibility.
Spillover of SARS-CoV-2 into novel wild hosts in North America: A conceptual model for perpetuation of the pathogen;There is evidence that the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is of animal origin. As with a number of zoonotic pathogens, there is a risk of spillover into novel hosts. Here, we propose a hypothesized conceptual model that illustrates the mechanism whereby the SARS-CoV-2 could spillover from infected humans to naive wildlife hosts in North America. This proposed model is premised on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human feces through municipal waste water treatment plants into the natural aquatic environment where potential wildlife hosts become infected. We use the existing literature on human coronaviruses, including SARS CoV, to support the potential pathways and mechanisms in the conceptual model. Although we focus on North America, our conceptual model could apply to other parts of the globe as well.
Is the anti-filarial drug diethylcarbamazine useful to treat COVID-19?;SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in a devastating pandemic of COVID-19. Exploring compounds that could offer a breakthrough in treatment is the need of the hour. Re-positioning cheap, freely available and safe drugs is a priority. The paper proposes evidence for the potential use of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) in the treatment of COVID-19. DEC has inhibitory effects on arachidonic acid metabolism to prostaglandins, little known anti-viral effects on animal retroviruses and demonstrated anti-inflammatory actions in animal models of lung inflammation indicating the need to explore this hypothesis further. We believe this is the first time DEC is being proposed to treat COVID-19.
;An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China
Insight into 2019 novel coronavirus — An updated interim review and lessons from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV;The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has become a global threat. Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions.
Fate of respiratory droplets in tropical vs temperate environments and implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission;The new pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has shown stark differences in number of affected patients between countries in the tropics and those with temperate environments. Though there have been many theories on reasons for these differences, we hypothesise that this could be due to differences in the fate of respiratory droplets in the two environments. A simple understanding of the mechanics of droplet size, dispersion and displacement could help infection control and public health measures to minimize spread and mitigate the risk of people getting infected especially in hotspots like hospital environments or other closed spaces. This paper discusses the possibility of differences in number of infections and spread between different countries based on the spread of droplets.
Transmission of COVID-19 in the terminal stages of the incubation period: A familial cluster;We report a familial cluster of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to assess its potential transmission during the incubation period. The first patient in this familial cluster was identified during the presymptomatic period, as a close contact of a confirmed patient. Five family members had close contact with this first patient during his incubation period, with four of them confirmed positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the subsequent sampling tests.
Treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and combination in patients hospitalized with COVID-19;The United States is in an acceleration phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently there is no known effective therapy or vaccine for treatment of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting urgency around identifying effective therapies.
COVID-19 exposure risk for family members of healthcare workers: An observational study;Many publications have considered the exposure risk to COVID-19 of the general population and healthcare workers. However, no available papers have discussed the risk of exposure by family members of health care workers.
CT imaging and clinical course of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia at admission in Wuhan, China;Aimed to characterize the CT imaging and clinical course of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia.
SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed only by cell culture isolation before the local outbreak in an Italian seven-week-old suckling baby;SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in December 2019 and has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. This paper described the case of a 7-week-old suckling baby from Italy who was SARS-CoV-2-positive only by the cell culture method, with no clinical suspicion of and/or risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The baby was referred to hospital, with signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, before the virus had spread to the province. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs and a nasopharyngeal aspirate were used for conventional and molecular diagnostic assays not including the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Bacteria referred to the resident population were revealed in nasal and pharyngeal swabs. No viruses were detected using both immunofluorescence assay and nucleic acid amplification assays in the nasopharyngeal aspirate. The baby was discharged in good condition after 3 days of hospitalisation. Later, a cytopathic effect on the cell monolayers currently used for respiratory viruses was observed and the viral particles were identified as 
Environment and COVID-19: Pollutants, impacts, dissemination, management and recommendations for facing future epidemic threats;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. Its relationship with environmental factors is an issue that has attracted the attention of scientists and governments. This article aims to deal with a possible association between COVID-19 and environmental factors and provide some recommendations for adequately controlling future epidemic threats. Environmental management through ecosystem services has a relevant role in exposing and spreading infectious diseases, reduction of pollutants, and control of climatic factors. Pollutants and viruses (such as COVID-19) produce negative immunological responses and share similar mechanisms of action. Therefore, they can have an additive and enhancing role in viral diseases. Significant associations between air pollution and COVID-19 have been reported. Particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) can obstruct the airway, exacerbating cases of COVID-19. Some climatic factors have been shown to affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Yet, it is not well established if climatic factors might have a cause-effect relationship to the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. So far, positive as well as negative indirect environmental impacts have been reported, with negative impacts greater and more persistent. Too little is known about the current pandemic to evaluate whether there is an association between environment and positive COVID-19 cases. We recommend smart technology to collect data remotely, the implementation of “one health” approach between public health physicians and veterinarians, and the use of biodegradable medical supplies in future epidemic threats.
Environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare premises;A large number of healthcare workers (HCWs) were infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs, patients, and visitors. No data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of Wuhan.
Ankaferd hemostat (ABS) as a potential mucosal topical agent for the management of COVID-19 syndrome based on its PAR-1 inhibitory effect and oestrogen content;COVID-19 due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection is a multi-systemic immune syndrome affecting mainly the lungs, oropharyngeal region, and other vascular endothelial beds. There are tremendous ongoing efforts for the aim of developing drugs against the COVID-19 syndrome-associated inflammation. However, currently no specific medicine is present for the absolute pharmacological cure of COVID-19 mucositis. The re-purposing/re-positioning of already existing drugs is a very important strategy for the management of ongoing pandemy since the development of a new drug needs decades. Apart from altering angiotensin signaling pathways, novel drug candidates for re-purposing comprise medications shall target COVID-19 pathobiology, including pharmaceutical formulations that antagonize proteinase-activated receptors (PARs), mainly PAR-1. Activation of the PAR-1, mediators and hormones impact on the hemostasis, endothelial activation, alveolar epithelial cells and mucosal inflammatory responses which are the essentials of the COVID-19 pathophysiology. In this context, Ankaferd hemostat (Ankaferd Blood Stopper, ABS) which is an already approved hemostatic agent affecting via vital erythroid aggregation and fibrinogen gamma could be a potential topical remedy for the mucosal management of COVID-19. ABS is a clinically safe and effective topical hemostatic agent of plant origin capable of exerting pleiotropic effects on the endothelial cells, angiogenesis, cell proliferation and vascular dynamics. ABS had been approved as a topically applied hemostatic agent for the management of post-surgical/dental bleedings and healing of infected inflammatory mucosal wounds. The anti-inflammatory and proteinase-activated receptor axis properties of ABS with a considerable amount of oestrogenic hormone presence highlight this unique topical hemostatic drug regarding the clinical re-positioning for COVID-19-associated mucositis. Topical ABS as a biological response modifier may lessen SARS-CoV-2 associated microthrombosis, endothelial dysfunction, oropharyngeal inflammation and mucosal lung damage. Moreover, PAR-1 inhibition ability of ABS might be helpful for reducing the initial virus propagation and mocasal spread of COVID-19.
Patterns of Viral Clearance in the Natural Course of Asymptomatic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Comparison with Symptomatic Nonsevere COVID-19;The aim of the study was to elucidate patterns of SARS-CoV-2 clearance in the natural course of asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
;The new zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus not previously seen in humans and which appears to come from bat species. It originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world, causing over 5,569,679 global cases and 351,866 deaths in almost every country in the world, including Europe, particularly Italy. In general, based on existing data published to date, 80.9% of patients infected with the virus develop mild infection
N-Acetylcysteine: A potential therapeutic agent for SARS-CoV-2;COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread across the globe. Predisposing factors such as age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and lowered immune function increase the risk of disease severity. T cell exhaustion, high viral load, and high levels of TNF-ɑ, IL1β, IL6, IL10 have been associated with severe SARS-CoV-2. Cytokine and antigen overstimulation are potentially responsible for poor humoral response to the virus. Lower cellular redox status, which leads to pro-inflammatory states mediated by TNF-ɑ is also potentially implicated. 
Could Imiquimod (5% Aldara) or Other TLR7 Agonists be Used in The Treatment of COVID-19?;Toll-like receptor 7 is critical in recognition of single strand RNA viruses, including SARS CoV-2, and generation of anti-viral immunity. Coronaviruses evolved strategies to dampen the host immunity. Herein, we discuss the potential use of TLR7 agonists in early stages of COVID-19.
Computational analysis of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 surveillance by wastewater-based epidemiology locally and globally: Feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges;With the economic and practical limits of medical screening for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 coming sharply into focus worldwide, scientists are turning now to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a potential tool for assessing and managing the pandemic. We employed computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE. Depending on local conditions, detection in community wastewater of one symptomatic/asymptomatic infected case per 100 to 2,000,000 non-infected people is theoretically feasible, with some practical successes now being reported from around the world. Computer simulations for past, present and emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables. WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it. Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US$), depending on a nation's population size and number of testing rounds conducted. For resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance. Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations. Not compensating for temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/over-estimation of infected cases. Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots. Data provided here demonstrate this approach to save money, be broadly applicable worldwide, and potentially aid in precision management of the pandemic, thereby helping to accelerate the global economic recovery that billions of people rely upon for their livelihoods.
Early SARS-CoV-2 outbreak detection by sewage-based epidemiology;Sewage can be used to determine the scale of COVID-19 outbreak. Sewage Epidemiology or Waste Based Epidemiology (WBE) approach has been successfully used to track and provide early warnings of outbreaks of pathogenic viruses such as Hepatitis A, Poliovirus and Norovirus. In untreated wastewater COVID-19 (excreted via faeces then introduced to wastewater) can survive from hours to days. Detection of COVID-19 can be carried out with nucleic acid−based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, used for confirmation of COVID-19 patients around the globe. New cheaper and faster monitoring tools are being developed to detect Covid-19 in wastewater by biosensors, ELISA, or paper-based indicator methods. This will allow to reveal true scale of Covid-19 outbreak associated with population link to a specific wastewater treatment plant.
Optimal temperature zone for the dispersal of COVID-19;It is essential to know the environmental parameters within which the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can survive to understand its global dispersal pattern. We found that 60.0% of the confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in places where the air temperature ranged from 5 °C to 15 °C, with a peak in cases at 11.54 °C. Moreover, approximately 73.8% of the confirmed cases were concentrated in regions with absolute humidity of 3 g/m
Air and surface contamination by SARS-CoV-2 virus in a tertiary hospital in Wuhan, China;Few studies have explored air and surface contamination by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in healthcare settings.
The assessment of transmission efficiency and latent infection period on asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 infection;Few studies aimed on the transmission efficiency of asymptomatic carriers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. A follow-up study was performed on 147 asymptomatic carriers in Anhui Province. Of 147 asymptomatic carriers, 50.0% were male, 50.3% cases were older than 40 years, and 43.8% were farmers, 68.7% cases were from north of Anhui Province. There were 16 asymptomatic carriers developed illness in the following 14 days isolated observation, and diagnosed as confirmed cases. The possible latent infection period was evaluated ranged from one to five days before onset, and the median time was two days. The second attack rate of 16 confirmed cases whom transferred from asymptomatic carriers was 9.7% (23/236), while 131 asymptomatic carriers caused 2.6% (24/914) close contacts infection, there was a significant difference of second attack rate among two groups (
Longitudinal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profile and neutralization activity of a COVID-19 patient;We followed–up a mild COVID-19 patient for 91 days and serially monitored his serum antibodies to four SARS-CoV-2 related antigens (NP, RBD, S1 and ECD) and neutralization activities. Our data revealed a profile of serial antibody responses during the progress and a quick decline of neutralization activities after discharge.
Does zinc supplementation enhance the clinical efficacy of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine to win today's battle against COVID-19?;Currently, drug repurposing is an alternative to novel drug development for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ) and its metabolite hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are currently being tested in several clinical studies as potential candidates to limit SARS-CoV-2-mediated morbidity and mortality. CQ and HCQ (CQ/HCQ) inhibit pH-dependent steps of SARS-CoV-2 replication by increasing pH in intracellular vesicles and interfere with virus particle delivery into host cells. Besides direct antiviral effects, CQ/HCQ specifically target extracellular zinc to intracellular lysosomes where it interferes with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and coronavirus replication. As zinc deficiency frequently occurs in elderly patients and in those with cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, or diabetes, we hypothesize that CQ/HCQ plus zinc supplementation may be more effective in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality than CQ or HCQ in monotherapy. Therefore, CQ/HCQ in combination with zinc should be considered as additional study arm for COVID-19 clinical trials.
Deceiving SARS-CoV-2 molecular-tropism clues – A combinational contemporary strategy;Several attempts to control the dreadfulness of SARS-CoV-2 are still underway. Based on the literature evidences we have speculated a prospective contemporary remedy, which was categorized into Specificity, Remedy, and a Conveyor. In which, pros and cons were discussed and inferred the possible alternatives. (a) Specificity: Implicit to express the ACE2 receptors in conveyor cells to deceive SARS-CoV-2 from prepone targets. (b) Remedy: As depletion of pulmonary surfactants causes strong acute respiratory distress syndrome, we propose an entity of a cost-effective artificial surfactant system as a remedy to pulmonary complications. (c) Conveyor: We propose red blood cells (RBCs) as a conveyor with embedded artificial surfactant and protruding ACE2 receptors for the target-specific delivery. Overall we postulate focused insights by employing a combinational contemporary strategy to steer towards a prospective direction on combating SARS-CoV-2.
Sunlight ultraviolet radiation dose is negatively correlated with the percent positive of SARS-CoV-2 and four others common human coronaviruses in the U.S.;Human coronaviruses are RNA viruses that are sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Sunlight contains UVA (320–400 nm), UVB (260–320 nm) and UVC (200–260 nm) action spectra. UVC can inactivate coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The incidence and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are considered to be correlated with vitamin D levels. Vitamin D synthesis in human skin is closely related to exposure to UVB radiation. Therefore, the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 are also considered to be correlated with Vitamin D levels. In this study, Spearman and Kendall rank correlation analysis tests were used to analyze the correlation between the average percent positive of five human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, CoVHKU1, CoVNL63, CoVOC43, and CoV229E) in the U.S. and the corresponding sunlight UV radiation dose The results indicated that the monthly average percent positive of four common coronaviruses was significantly negatively correlated with the sunlight UV radiation dose. The weekly percent positive of SARS-CoV-2 during April 17, 2020 to July 10, 2020 showed a significant negative correlation with the sunlight UV radiation dose in census regions 1 and 2 of the U.S. while no statistical significance in the other regions. Additionally, sunlight UV radiation also showed some negative effects with respect to the early SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Potential spreading risks and disinfection challenges of medical wastewater by the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA in septic tanks of Fangcang Hospital;The outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia raises the concerns of effective deactivation of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in medical wastewater by disinfectants. In this study, we evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in septic tanks of Wuchang Cabin Hospital and found a striking high level of (0.5–18.7) × 10
Inoculum at the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and risk of disease severity;A relationship between the infecting dose and the risk of disease severity has not been demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we report three clusters of individuals that were potentially exposed to distinct inoculum in Madrid. Overall each group developed divergent clinical forms of COVID-19. Our data support that a greater viral inoculum at the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure might determine a higher risk of severe COVID-19.
Clinical and computed tomographic imaging features of novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2;To investigate the clinical and imaging characteristics of computed tomography (CT) in novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Presence and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewaters and rivers;The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewaters has been demonstrated in many countries affected by this pandemic. Nevertheless, virus presence and infectivity in treated wastewaters, but also in the receiving water bodies are still poorly investigated. In this study, raw and treated samples from three wastewater treatment plants, and three river samples within the Milano Metropolitan Area, Italy, were surveyed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by means of real time RT-PCR and infectivity test on culture cells. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in raw, but not in treated wastewaters (four and two samples, respectively, sampled in two dates). The isolated virus genome was sequenced, and belonged to the strain most spread in Europe and similar to another found in the same region. RNA presence in raw wastewater samples decreased after eight days, probably following the epidemiological trend estimated for the area. Virus infectivity was always null, indicating the natural decay of viral pathogenicity in time from emission. Samples from receiving rivers (three sites, sampled in the same dates as wastewaters) showed in some cases a positivity to real time RT-PCR, probably due to non-treated, or inefficiently treated discharges, or to the combined sewage overflows. Nevertheless, also for rivers infectivity was null. Risks for public health should be limited, although a precautionary approach to risk assessment is here advocated, giving the preliminary nature of the presented data.
;The literature on municipal solid waste in relation to COVID-19 is scarce. Based on the experience of Italy, the present article contributes to the strategies aimed at preventing a second virus outbreak. In fact, the mismanagement of municipal solid waste could undermine the strategies during the ease of the lockdown. During the SARS-COV-2 outbreak in Italy, there was a general decrease in the selective collection rate (−15% in one municipality with a well-developed door-to-door collection system). Delays in the publication of guidelines on waste management impacted on the safety of the operators collecting potentially infected waste. Contrarily to expectations, single-use masks and gloves do not have significant impact on waste management, accounting for <1% of the residual municipal solid waste collected annually. However, the dispersion of abandoned masks and gloves outside indoor environments is creating environmental problems. Recommendations on waste management and the protection of waste operators are discussed. Finally, guidelines on the most appropriate waste treatment are presented and analyzed. The results presented in this article show that the MSW management sector has found useful solutions to tackle COVID-19
SARS-CoV-2 from faeces to wastewater treatment: What do we know? A review;SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been found in the faeces of infected patients in numerous studies. Stool may remain positive for SARS-CoV-2, even when the respiratory tract becomes negative, and the interaction with the gastrointestinal tract poses a series of questions about wastewater and its treatments. This review aims to understand the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces and sewage and its fate in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).
Saliva is a reliable tool to detect SARS-CoV-2;This study analyzed salivary samples of COVID-19 patients and compared the results with their clinical and laboratory data.
How is immunosuppressive status affecting children and adults in SARS-CoV-2 infection? A systematic review;SARS-CoV-2 infection has now a global resonance. Data on how COVID-19 is affecting immunocompromised patients are however few. With our study we aimed to systematically review the current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 cases in children and adults with immunosuppression, to evaluate outcomes in this special population.
Physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection to prevent person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 and is spread person-to-person through close contact. We aimed to investigate the effects of physical distance, face masks, and eye protection on virus transmission in health-care and non-health-care (eg, community) settings.
Serum albumin-mediated strategy for the effective targeting of SARS-CoV-2;Novel coronavirus (NCoV-19), also known as SARS CoV-2, is a pathogen causing an emerging infection that rapidly increases in incidence and geographic range, is associated with the ever-increasing morbidity and mortality rates, and shows sever economic impact worldwide. The WHO declares the NCoV-19 infection disease (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and subsequently, on March 11, 2020, declared it a Global Pandemic. Although some people infected with SARS CoV-2 have no symptoms, the spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical, with most COVID-19 infections being not severe. The common mild symptoms include body aches, dry cough, fatigue, low-grade fever, nasal congestion, and sore throat. More severe COVID-19 symptoms are typical of pneumonia, and upon progression, the patient’s condition can worsen with severe respiratory and cardiac problems. Currently, there is no drug or vaccine for curing patients. It has been observed that people with challenged immunity are highly prone to SARS CoV-2 infection and least likely to recover. Also, older adults and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe forms of COVID-19. We are suggesting here a strategy for the COVID-19 treatment that could be effective in curing the patients in the current scenario when no efficient medicine or Vaccine is currently available, and Clinicians solely depend upon the performing trials with drugs with known antiviral activities. Our proposed strategy is based on the compilation of published scientific research and concepts. The different published research indicates the success of a similar strategy in different physiological conditions, and such a strategy is widely studied at the cellular level and in animal models.
Differential immune activation profile of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection in human lung and intestinal cells: Implications for treatment with IFN-β and IFN inducer;Respiratory and intestinal tract are two primary target organs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, detailed characterization of the host-virus interplay in infected human lung and intestinal epithelial cells is lacking.
;Rapid detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and preventing the spread of the virus. A novel detection kit – the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit (nCoV-DK) – halves the detection time by eliminating the steps of RNA extraction and purification. We evaluated the concordance between the nCoV-DK and direct PCR. The virus was detected in 53/71 specimens (74.6%) by direct PCR and in 55/71 specimens (77.5%) by nCoV-DK
First environmental surveillance for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water in Japan;Wastewater-based epidemiology is a powerful tool to understand the actual incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a community because severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19, can be shed in the feces of infected individuals regardless of their symptoms. The present study aimed to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, using four quantitative and two nested PCR assays. Influent and secondary-treated (before chlorination) wastewater samples and river water samples were collected five times from a wastewater treatment plant and three times from a river, respectively, between March 17 and May 7, 2020. The wastewater and river water samples (200–5000 mL) were processed by using two different methods: the electronegative membrane-vortex (EMV) method and the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. Based on the observed concentrations of indigenous pepper mild mottle virus RNA, the EMV method was found superior to the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was successfully detected in one of five secondary-treated wastewater samples with a concentration of 2.4 × 10
Asymptomatic infection by SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers: a study in a large teaching hospital in Wuhan, China;To investigate the proportion and characteristics of asymptomatic infection among healthcare workers (HCWs).
Possible intrauterine infection: Positive nucleic acid testing results and consecutive positive SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels within 50 days after birth;Whether SARS-CoV-2 affects fetus in utero is important to the well-being of mother and neonate. We report a full-term neonate born to the mother who developed symptoms of COVID-19 at 32-week gestational age. The placental pathology showed local slight inflammation. Serial quantitative antibody measurements in the neonate showed the level of IgM was elevated at the day of birth and gradually declined to negative within 28 days of life, the levels of IgG declined gradually but still positive at 50th day of life. The dynamic change trend of antibody levels in the neonate was consistent with that in his mother. One-step Reverse Transcriptase-droplet digital Polymerase Chain Reaction for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing from throat and anal swabs showed positive results (750 and 892 copies/ml) at 7th day of life and negative results at 14th day of life. The neonate had no symptom of COVID-19. This report enables us to reevaluate the significance of IgM detection in intrauterine infection of SARS-CoV-2, and presents a favorable prognosis in the neonate with long-term exposure to maternal COVID-19, despite great possibility of intrauterine infection.
Respiratory conditions in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Important considerations regarding novel treatment strategies to reduce mortality;A novel virus named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) causes symptoms that are classified as coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Respiratory conditions are extensively described among more serious cases of COVID-19, and the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the hallmark features of critical COVID-19 cases. ARDS can be directly life-threatening because it is associated with low blood oxygenation levels and can result in organ failure. There are no generally recognized effective treatments for COVID-19, but treatments are urgently needed. Anti-viral medications and vaccines are in the early developmental stages and may take many months or even years to fully develop. At present, management of COVID-19 with respiratory and ventilator support are standard therapeutic treatments, but unfortunately such treatments are associated with high mortality rates. Therefore, it is imperative to consider novel new therapeutic interventions to treat/ameliorate respiratory conditions associated with COVID-19. Alternate treatment strategies utilizing clinically available treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions, or erthropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy were hypothesized to increase oxygenation of tissues by alternative means than standard respiratory and ventilator treatments. It was also revealed that alternative treatments currently being considered for COVID-19 such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine by increasing hemoglobin production and increasing hemoglobin availability for oxygen binding and acetazolamine (for the treatment of altitude sickness) by causing hyperventilation with associated increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the blood may significantly ameliorate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms. In conclusion, is recommend, given HBOT, pRBC, and ESA therapies are currently available and routinely utilized in the treatment of other conditions, that such therapies be tried among COVID-19 patients with serious respiratory conditions and that future controlled-clinical trials explore the potential usefulness of such treatments among COVID-19 patients with respiratory conditions.
Environmental contamination by SARS-CoV-2 of an imported case during incubation period;We collected environmental surface samples prior to and after disinfection of a quarantine room to evaluate the stability of SARS-CoV-2 during the incubation period of an imported case traveling to Qingdao, China. Overall, 11 of 23 (47.8%) of the first batch of environmental surface samples (within 4 h after case confirmation) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Whereas only 2 of 23 (8.7%) of the second batch of environmental samples (after first disinfection) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The majority of samples from the bedroom (70%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, followed by 50% of samples from the bathroom and that of 33% from the corridor. The inner walls of toilet bowl and sewer inlet were the most contaminated sites with the highest viral loads. SARS-CoV-2 was widely distributed on object surfaces in a quarantine room of a later diagnosed COVID-19 case during the incubation period. Proper disinfection is crucial to minimize community transmission of this highly contagious virus.
Shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in feces and urine and its potential role in person-to-person transmission and the environment-based spread of COVID-19;The recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces has led to speculation that it can be transmitted via the fecal-oral/ocular route. This review aims to critically evaluate the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, the quantity and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in feces and urine, and whether these pose an infection risk in sanitary settings, sewage networks, wastewater treatment plants, and the wider environment (e.g. rivers, lakes and marine waters). A review of 48 independent studies revealed that severe GI dysfunction is only evident in a small number of COVID-19 cases, with 11 ± 2% exhibiting diarrhea and 12 ± 3% exhibiting vomiting and nausea. In addition to these cases, SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in feces from some asymptomatic, mildly- and pre-symptomatic individuals. Fecal shedding of the virus peaks in the symptomatic period and can persist for several weeks, but with declining abundances in the post-symptomatic phase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is occasionally detected in urine, but reports in fecal samples are more frequent. The abundance of the virus genetic material in both urine (ca. 10
;In order to benefit the public, community workers and scientific community, we hereby present a chronicle of SARS-CoV-2 that leads to the unseen precedent of social distancing and lockdown owing to coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Information on this life-threatening pandemic of COVID-19 is sparse and discrete
First detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in North America: A study in Louisiana, USA;We investigated the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in wastewater samples in southern Louisiana, USA. Untreated and treated wastewater samples were collected on five occasions over a four-month period from January to April 2020. The wastewater samples were concentrated via ultrafiltration (Method A), and an adsorption–elution method using electronegative membranes (Method B). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 2 out of 15 wastewater samples using two reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays (CDC N1 and N2). None of the secondary treated and final effluent samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in North America, including the USA. However, concentration methods and RT-qPCR assays need to be refined and validated to increase the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in wastewater.
Current approach in laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2;An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that began in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, has rapidly spread to produce a global pandemic. It is now clear that person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been occurring and that the epidemic has been dramatically growing in recent months. Early, rapid and accurate diagnosis is of great significance for curtailing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. At present, several diagnostic techniques, e.g., viral culture, nucleic acid amplification test, have been used to detect the virus. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these methods are quite different, with the sample source and detection limit varying greatly. Here, we review all the types and characteristics of the current laboratory diagnostic assays available for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection and summarize the selection strategies of testing and sampling sites at different disease stages to improve the diagnostic accuracy of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Rapid implementation of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing to investigate cases of health-care associated COVID-19: a prospective genomic surveillance study;The burden and influence of health-care associated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections is unknown. We aimed to examine the use of rapid SARS-CoV-2 sequencing combined with detailed epidemiological analysis to investigate health-care associated SARS-CoV-2 infections and inform infection control measures.
First detection of SARS-CoV-2 in untreated wastewaters in Italy;Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of environmental surveillance through the monitoring of sewage for the assessment of viruses circulating in a given community (wastewater-based epidemiology, WBE).
Spironolactone may provide protection from SARS-CoV-2: Targeting androgens, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS);In coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), four major factors have been correlated with worse prognosis: aging, hypertension, obesity, and exposure to androgen hormones. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) action are critical for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) cell entry and infectivity. ACE2 expression and RAAS are abnormal in hypertension and obesity, while TMPRSS2 is overexpressed when exposed to androgens, which may justify why these factors are overrepresented in COVID-19.
Sensitivity of different RT-qPCR solutions for SARS-CoV-2 detection;The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to impose demands on diagnostic screening. In anticipation that the recurrence of outbreaks and the measures for lifting the lockdown worldwide may cause supply chain issues over the coming months, this study assessed the sensitivity of a number of one-step retrotranscription and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) solutions to detect SARS-CoV-2.
Lack of antiviral activity of darunavir against SARS-CoV-2;Given the high need and the absence of specific antivirals for treatment of COVID-19 (the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors are being considered as therapeutic alternatives.
Common determinants of severe Covid-19 infection are explicable by SARS-CoV-2 secreted glycoprotein interaction with the CD33-related Siglecs, Siglec-3 and Siglec-5/14;SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the ACE-2 receptor cannot alone explain the demography and remarkable variation in clinical progression of Covid-19 infection.
;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and represents a potentially fatal disease of great global public health importance. As of March 26, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in 462,801 confirmed cases and 20,839 deaths globally, which is more than those caused by SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2003 and 2013, respectively. The epidemic has posed considerable challenges worldwide. Under a strict mechanism of massive prevention and control, China has seen a rapid decrease in new cases of coronavirus
The spread of 2019-nCoV in China was primarily driven by population density. Comment on “Association between short-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 infection: Evidence from China” by Zhu et al.;Recently, an article published in the journal 
A field indoor air measurement of SARS-CoV-2 in the patient rooms of the largest hospital in Iran;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city, China, in late 2019 and has rapidly spread throughout the world. The major route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is in contention, with the airborne route a likely transmission pathway for carrying the virus within indoor environments. Until now, there has been no evidence for detection of airborne severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this may have implication for the potential spread of the COVID-19. We investigated the air of patient rooms with confirmed COVID-19 in the largest hospital in Iran, on March 17, 2020. To collect the SARS-CoV-2 particles, ten air samples were collected into the sterile standard midget impingers containing 20 mL DMEM with 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin and 1% antifoam reagent for 1 h. Besides, indoor particle number concentrations, CO
Evaluation of novel antigen-based rapid detection test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples;In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the development and validation of rapid and easy-to-perform diagnostic methods are of high priority. We evaluated a novel rapid antigen detection test (RDT) for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples.
;There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019
Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in 104 people with SARS-CoV-2 infection on the ;The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat. Identification of markers for symptom onset and disease progression is a pressing issue. We described the clinical features of people infected on board the 
The role of community-wide wearing of face mask for control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic due to SARS-CoV-2;Face mask usage by the healthy population in the community to reduce risk of transmission of respiratory viruses remains controversial. We assessed the effect of community-wide mask usage to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
Serological immunochromatographic approach in diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 infected COVID-19 patients;An outbreak of new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was occurred in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other cities and nations. The standard diagnostic approach that widely adopted in the clinic is nucleic acid detection by real-time RT-PCR. However, the false-negative rate of the technique is unneglectable and serological methods are urgently warranted. Here, we presented the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic (ICG) strip targeting viral IgM or IgG antibody and compared it with real-time RT-PCR. The sensitivity of ICG assay with IgM and IgG combinatorial detection in nucleic acid confirmed cases were 11.1%, 92.9% and 96.8% at the early stage (1–7 days after onset), intermediate stage (8–14 days after onset), and late stage (more than 15 days), respectively. The ICG detection capacity in nucleic acid-negative suspected cases was 43.6%. In addition, the concordance of whole blood samples and plasma showed Cohen's kappa value of 0.93, which represented the almost perfect agreement between two types of samples. In conclusion, serological ICG strip assay in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection is both sensitive and consistent, which is considered as an excellent supplementary approach in clinical application.
A case of transient existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the respiratory tract with the absence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response;We report the case of a patient who had travelled to Japan and who presented mild respiratory symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak period. There was transient existence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in his oropharynx. The RNA was absent in the six respiratory specimens that were subsequently tested. An anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response was absent in the acute and convalescent sera. The reported case indicates that transient colonization of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract is possible without inciting any antibody response against the virus.
Multiple assays in a real-time RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 panel can mitigate the risk of loss of sensitivity by new genomic variants during the COVID-19 outbreak;In this study, five SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay panels were evaluated against the accumulated genetic variability of the virus to assess the effect on sensitivity of the individual assays.
Specific ACE2 expression in small intestinal enterocytes may cause gastrointestinal symptoms and injury after 2019-nCoV infection;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread in other countries in December 2019. The infected patients presented with fever, respiratory symptoms, sometimes with digestive and other systemic manifestations, and some progressed with a severe acute respiratory syndrome or even death. Associated digestive symptoms were frequently observed in the patients, with an unknown significance and mechanism. ACE2, as the major known functional receptor of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) attracted our attention. We collected the clinical data of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients from published studies and extracted the data about the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, we used online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs, especially in the small intestine, to explore the relationship between ACE2 expression patterns and clinical symptoms. We found that diarrhea accounted for a notable proportion of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 8.0% to 12.9%. The results reveal that ACE2 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the small intestinal enterocytes but not in the goblet cells or intestinal immune cells. High expression of ACE2 on the surface cells in the digestive tract may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation susceptibility. Overall, digestive symptoms were common in the COVID-19 patients. ACE2 expression on surface cells of the small intestine may mediate the invasion and amplification of the virus and activation of gastrointestinal inflammation. It is a possible mechanism of digestive symptoms in the COVID-19 patients and explains the presence of the virus in patients’ stool samples. The study also highlights the necessity of taking stool samples for suspected patients to help in early diagnosis and assessment of disease status.
The incidence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic patients: A systematic review;The recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread globally since its discovery in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. A comprehensive strategy – including surveillance, diagnostics, research, and clinical treatment – is urgently needed to win the battle against COVID-19. Recently, numerous studies have reported the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients. Yet, the incidence and viral transmission from the asymptomatic cases are not yet apparent.
Diagnostic serial interval as a novel indicator for contact tracing effectiveness exemplified with the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea;The clinical onset serial interval is often used as a proxy for the transmission serial interval of an infectious disease. For SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, data on clinical onset serial intervals is limited, since symptom onset dates are not routinely recorded and do not exist in asymptomatic carriers.
;The comparison of the numbers of cases and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 shows that people in Central Europe are much more affected than people in East Asia where the disease originally occurred. Trying to explain this difference, this communication presents four hypotheses that propose the following reasons for the observed findings: 1) Differences in social behaviors and cultures of people in the two regions
;The COVID-19 outbreak has rapidly progressed worldwide finding the health system, scientists and society unprepared to face a little-known, fast spreading, and extremely deadly virus. Italy is one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic, resulting in healthcare facilities bearing heavy burdens and severe restrictive measures. Despite efforts to clarify the virus transmission, especially in indoor scenarios, several aspects of SARS-CoV-2 spread are still rudimentary. This study evaluated the contamination of the air and surfaces by SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the COVID-19 isolation ward of a hospital in Milan, Italy. A total of 42 air and surface samples were collected inside five different zones of the ward including contaminated (COVID-19 patients' area), semi-contaminated (undressing room), and clean areas. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was performed using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Overall, 24.3% of swab samples were positive, but none of these were collected in the clean area. Thus, the positivity rate was higher in contaminated (35.0%) and semi-contaminated (50.0%) areas than in clean areas (0.0%
Evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: A global health emergency;According to data compiled by researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, more than two and half million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a newly discovered virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been confirmed on April 20, 2020 (Nature, 2020b). Since the emergence of this infectious disease in Asia (Wuhan, China) late last year, it has been subsequently span to every continent of the world except Antarctica (Rodríguez-Morales et al., 2020). Along with a foothold in every country, the current disease pandemic is disrupting practically every aspect of life all over the world. As the outbreak are continuing to evolve, several research activities have been conducted for better understanding the origin, functions, treatments, and preventions of this novel coronavirus. This review will be a summa of the key features of novel coronavirus (nCoV), the virus causing disease 2019 and the present epidemic situation worldwide up to April 20, 2020. It is expected that this record will play an important role to take more preventive measures for overcoming the challenges faced during this current pandemic.
SARS-CoV-2 turned positive in a discharged patient with COVID-19 arouses concern regarding the present standards for discharge;An outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to a serious epidemic in China and other countries, resulting in worldwide concern. With active efforts of prevention and control, more and more patients are being discharged. However, how to manage these patients normatively is still challenging. This paper reports an asymptomatic discharged patient with COVID-19 who retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, which arouses concern regarding the present discharge standards of COVID-19.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using commercial assays and seroconversion patterns in hospitalized patients;SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays are needed for serological surveys and as a complement to molecular tests to confirm COVID-19. However, the kinetics of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly described and relies on the performance of the different serological tests.
Importation of SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to major COVID-19 epidemic in Taiwan;COVID-19 has recently become a pandemic affecting many countries worldwide. This study aims to evaluate the current status of COVID-19 in Taiwan and analyze the source of infection.
Snowballing transmission of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) through wastewater: Any sustainable preventive measures to curtail the scourge in low-income countries?;In this communication, we proposed sustainable preventive measures that may be adopted by the low-income countries to forestall the potential outbreak and transmission of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) through wastewater. Most low-income countries have poor sanitation and wastewater management policies, which create potential risks of COVID 19 spread. Hence, the proposed measures include decentralization of wastewater treatment facilities, community-wide monitoring and testing of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples, improved sanitation, developing point-of-use devices for wastewater decontamination, and more focused policy interventions. Therefore, this paper adds useful insights into the monitoring and management of ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in low-income countries.
Antimalarial artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) and COVID-19 in Africa: ;At the end of November 2019, a novel coronavirus responsible for respiratory tract infections (COVID-19) emerged in China. Despite drastic containment measures, this virus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread in Asia and Europe. The pandemic is ongoing with particular hotspot in Southern Europe and America. Many studies predicted a similar epidemic in Africa as that currently seen in Europe and the United States of America. However, reported data do not confirm these predictions. One of the hypotheses that could explain the later emergence and spread of COVID-19 pandemic in African countries is the use of antimalarial drugs to treat malaria, and more particularly artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT).
Persistence of intestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with COVID-19 leads to re-admission after pneumonia resolved;The current reports of COVID-19 focus on the respiratory system, however, intestinal infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 are also worthy of attention. This paper reported persistence of intestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to re-admission after pneumonia resolved in three cases with COVID-19.
High SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 patients;The seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was examined among 105 healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to four patients who were laboratory confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These HCWs were immediately under quarantine for 14 days as soon as they were identified as close contacts. The nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected on the first and 14
Expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and proteases in COVID-19 patients: A potential role of cellular FURIN in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2;Recently, a mini-review was published in the Medical Hypotheses journal by Usul Afsar entitled 2019-nCoV-SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection: Cruciality of Furin and relevance with cancer. Previous studies have pointed out that disruption of the proteolytic cleavage of proteins can promote infectious and non-infectious diseases. The last few weeks have been marked by an important revelation concerning the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2. This new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious and transmissible acute respiratory infectious disorder. SARS-CoV-2 is composed of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and structural proteins including Spike protein (S protein). Interestingly, the FURIN, one of the proproteins of the convertase family, plays a crucial role in the maturation of viral glycoproteins. In addition, many viruses including coronaviruses, exploit FURIN for the activation of their glycoproteins. Recent data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Subsequently, the S protein is cleaved by transmembrane protease serine 2 with the help of FURIN which facilitates the entry of the virus into the cell after binding. Furthermore, it seems that FURIN is implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and potentially in the increased rates of human-to-human transmission.
Increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in staff working across different care homes enchanced CoVID-19 outbreak investigations in London care Homes;Care homes have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to suffer large outbreaks even when community infection rates are declining, thus representing important pockets of transmission. We assessed occupational risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among staff in six care homes experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak during the peak of the pandemic in London, England.
Hospital indoor air quality monitoring for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus;On December 31, 2019, the novel human coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China and swiftly spread in all nations and territories around the globe. There is much debate about the major route of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmissions. So, more evidence is required to determine the potential pathway of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 including airborne transmission. Therefore, we examined the potential aerosol transmission of the virus through hospital wards indoor air by confirmed COVID-19 patients on May 7, 2020. In order to capture airborne SARS-CoV-2, the liquid impinger biosampler was used to take fourteen air samples in different wards of the indoor air of the hospital. The specific primer and probe real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were applied to detect viral genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in positive air samples. Accordingly, we found two positive air samples (in the ICU) out of 14 ones taken from different wards with confirmed COVID-19 patients. The results revealed the possibility of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 though more studies are required to determine the role of actual mechanisms such as cough, sneeze, normal breathing and speaking in the emission of airborne size carrier aerosols. Likewise, more quantitative analyses are needed to estimate airborne viability of SARS-CoV-2 in the carrier aerosols.
SARS-CoV-2 clearance in COVID-19 patients with Novaferon treatment: A randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial;The antiviral effects of Novaferon, a potent antiviral protein drug, on COVID-19 was evaluated in the laboratory, and in a randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial.
Recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in COVID-19: A case report;The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan, China, has constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, with cases confirmed in multiple countries. Currently, patients are the primary source of infection. We report a confirmed case of COVID-19 whose oropharyngeal swab test of SARS-CoV-2 RNA turned positive in convalescence. This case highlights the importance of active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for infectivity assessment.
