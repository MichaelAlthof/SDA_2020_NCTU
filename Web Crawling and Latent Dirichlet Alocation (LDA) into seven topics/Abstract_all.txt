Abstract:A daily systemic risk measure is proposed accounting for links and mutualdependencies between financial institutions utilising tail event information. FRM(Financial Risk Meter) is based on Lasso quantile regression designed to capturetail event co-movements. The FRM focus lies on understanding active set datacharacteristics and the presentation of interdependencies in a network topology.Two FRM indices are presented, namely, FRM@Americas and FRM@Europe. The FRMindices detect systemic risk at selected areas and identifies risk factors. Inpractice, FRM is applied to the return time series of selected financialinstitutions and macroeconomic risk factors. Using FRM on a daily basis, weidentify companies exhibiting extreme "co-stress", as well as "activators" ofstress. With the SRM@EuroArea, we extend to the government bond asset class. FRMis a good predictor for recession probabilities, constituting the FRM-impliedrecession probabilities. Thereby, FRM indicates tail event behaviour in anetwork of financial risk factors.Keywords:Systemic Risk, Quantile Regression, Financial Markets, Risk Management, NetworkDynamics, Recession

Abstract:We propose an approach to calibrate the conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR) offinancial institutions based on neural network quantile regression. Building onthe estimation results we model systemic risk spillover effects across banks byconsidering the marginal effects of the quantile regression procedure. We adopt adropout regularization procedure to remedy the well-known issue of overfittingfor neural networks, and we provide empirical evidence for the favorable out-of-sample performance of a regularized neural network. We then propose threemeasures for systemic risk from our fitted results. We find that systemic riskincreases sharply during the height of the financial crisis in 2008 and againafter a short period of easing in 2011 and 2015. Our approach also allowsidentifying systemically relevant firms during the financial crisis.Keywords:Systemic risk, CoVaR, Quantile regression, Neural networks

Abstract:The aim of this paper is to prove the phenotypic convergence ofcryptocurrencies, in the sense that individual cryptocurrencies respond tosimilar selection pressures by developing similar characteristics. In order toretrieve the cryptocurrencies phenotype, we treat cryptocurrencies as financialinstruments (genus proximum) and find their specific difference (differentia specifica) by using the daily time series of log-returns. In this sense, a daily timeseries of asset returns (either cryptocurrencies or classical assets) can becharacterized by a multidimensional vector with statistical components likevolatility, skewness, kurtosis, tail probability, quantiles, conditional tailexpectation or fractal dimension. By using dimension reduction techniques(Factor Analysis) and classification models (Binary Logistic Regression,Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines, K-means clustering, VarianceComponents Split methods) for a representative sample of cryptocurrencies,stocks, exchange rates and commodities, we are able to classify cryptocurrenciesas a new asset class with unique features in the tails of the log-returnsdistribution. The main result of our paper is the complete separation of thecryptocurrencies from the other type of assets, by using the Maximum VarianceComponents Split method. More, we observe a divergent evolution of thecryptocurrencies species, compared to the classical assets, mainly due to thetails behaviour of the log-returns distribution.

Abstract:The paper presents a systematic theory for asymptotic inferences based onautocovariances of stationary processes. We consider nonparametric tests for serial correlations using the maximum and the quadratic deviations of sampleautocovariances. For these cases, with proper centering and rescaling, theasymptotic distributions of the deviations are Gumbel and Gaussian, respectively. To establish such an asymptotic theory, as byproducts, we develop anormal comparison principle and propose a sufficient condition for summabilityof joint cumulants of stationary processes. We adapt a blocks of blocksbootstrapping procedure proposed by Kuensch (1989) and Liu and Singh (1992) tothe maximum deviation based tests to improve the finite-sample performance.Keywords:Autocovariance, blocks of blocks bootstrapping, Box-Pierce test, extreme valuedistribution, moderate deviation, normal comparison, physical dependencemeasure, short range dependence, stationary process, summability of cumulants

Abstract:The 2017 bubble on the cryptocurrency market recalls our memory in the dot-combubble, during which hard-to-measure fundamentals and investors’ illusion forbrand new technologies led to overvalued prices. Benefiting from the massiveincrease in the volume of messages published on social media and message boards,we examine the impact of investor sentiment, conditional on bubble regimes, oncryptocurrencies aggregate return prediction. Constructing a crypto-specificlexicon and using a local-momentum autoregression model, we find that thesentiment effect is prolonged and sustained during the bubble while it turns outa reversal effect once the bubble collapsed. The out-of-sample analysis alongwith portfolio analysis is conducted in this study. When measuring investorsentiment for a new type of asset such as cryptocurrencies, we highlight thatthe impact of investor sentiment on cryptocurrency returns is conditional onbubble regimes.Keywords:Cryptocurrency; Sentiment; Bubble; Return Predictability

Abstract:Increasingly volatile and distributed energy production challenge traditionalmechanisms to manage grid loads and price energy. Local energy markets (LEMs)may be a response to those challenges as they can balance energy production andconsumption locally and may lower energy costs for consumers. Blockchain-basedLEMs provide a decentralized market to local energy consumer and prosumers. Theyimplement a market mechanism in the form of a smart contract without the needfor a central authority coordinating the market. Recently proposed blockchain-based LEMs use auction designs to match future demand and supply. Thus, suchblockchain-based LEMs rely on accurate short-term forecasts of individualhouseholds’ energy consumption and production. Often, such accurate forecastsare simply assumed to be given. The present research tests this assumption.First, by evaluating the forecast accuracy achievable with state-of-the-artenergy forecasting techniques for individual households and, second, byassessing the effect of prediction errors on market outcomes in three differentsupply scenarios. The evaluation shows that, although a LASSO regression modelis capable of achieving reasonably low forecasting errors, the costly settlementof prediction errors can offset and even surpass the savings brought toconsumers by a blockchain-based LEM. This shows, that due to prediction errors,participation in LEMs may be uneconomical for consumers, and thus, has to betaken into consideration for pricing mechanisms in blockchain-based LEMs.Keywords:Blockchain; Local Energy Market; Smart Contract; Machine Learning; Household;Energy Prediction; Prediction Errors; Market Mechanism

Abstract:We consider a new procedure for detecting structural breaks in mean for high-dimensional time series. We target breaks happening at unknown time points andlocations. In particular, at a fixed time point our method is concerned witheither the biggest break in one location or aggregating simultaneous breaks overmultiple locations. We allow for both big or small sized breaks, so that we ca), stamp the dates and the locations of the breaks, 2), estimate the breaksizes and 3), make inference on the break sizes as well as the break dates. Ourtheoretical setup incorporates both temporal and crosssectional dependence, andis suitable for heavy-tailed innovations. We derive the asymptotic distributionfor the sizes of the breaks by extending the existing powerful theory on locallinear kernel estimation and high dimensional Gaussian approximation to allowfor trend stationary time series with jumps. A robust long-run covariance matrixestimation is proposed, which can be of independent interest. An application ondetecting structural changes of the US unemployment rate is considered toillustrate the usefulness of our method.Keywords:high-dimensional time series, multiple change-points, Gaussian approximation,nonparametric estimation, heavy tailed, long-run covariance matrix

Abstract:In this paper, we build an overlapping generation model to examine the reasonwhy developed countries with similar background have implemented differentsocial health insurance systems. We propose two hypotheses to explain thisphenomenon: (i) the different participation rates of the poor in the voting;(ii) the distinct attitudes towards the size of the government and the existenceof a compulsory social health insurance system. Agents need to vote for one oftwo policies: Policy I without Social Health Insurance (SHI) but with thesubsidy for the poor, and Policy II with fully covered SHI. By comparing eithertheir current utility or the expected life time utility, households will chooseone policy. We find that under Policy I, the derivative of the changes ofexpected utility with respect to income is not monotonic. This means that boththe poorest and the richest dislike the social health insurance system. With thecalibrated parameters, we solve the benchmark and find that the public’sattitude towards the size of the government and the lower representation of thepoor affect the election result. The changes in the minimum consumption levelunder Policy I affect the voting results most, followed by the attitude. VotingParticipant rate plays the most insignificant role in the voting outcome. Thesensitivity analysis shows that our main findings are robust to the inputparameters.Keywords:Social Health Insurance, Voting

Abstract:In this paper, we develop an multi period overlapping generation framework toinvestigate agents' consumption and saving decisions, inequality and welfareamong elderly. We assume that agents are heterogeneous in the non-asset incomeand the medical expenditure. In order to explicitly analyze the e ects ofmedical expenditure, we conduct three counterfactual exercises. We successivelyshut down the heterogeneity in labor income, in the level and in the dispersionof medical expenses respectively. By comparing the benchmark with thecounterfactual results, we  nd that in general wealth inequality decreases withage, and income uncertainty contributes the most to wealth inequality. Bothaverage consumption and consumption inequality increase with age. Consumptioninequality largely tracks income inequality. Though uncertainty in medicalexpenditures has little e ect on consumption inequality, a higher level ofmedical expenditures may exacerbate consumption inequality. Meanwhile, theaverage saving of elderly exhibits an inverse-U shape with age. The impacts onaverage saving are similar both in benchmark and in counterfactual exercises.Welfare increases with age.Keywords:Income Inequality, Social Mobility, Price-to-rent ratio

Abstract:Housing typically takes up a major proportion of households' expenditure, andthus it certainly plays a critical role in shaping the pattern of income in-equality and social mobility. Whether high housing price-to-rent ratio will am-plify inequality and inhibit social class upgrading is still a controversialissue in the existing literature. In this paper, we develop a partialequilibrium life- cycle framework to address these issues. Agents in our economyare divided into two social classes according to the initial human capital levelinherited from their parents. Those who belong to upper class will draw theirinnate abilities from a distribution that  rst order stochastically dominatesthose from lower class. Throughout the entire lifecycle, agents make endogenoushuman capital investment and housing tenure decisions. We calibrate the model tomimic some stylized facts in the the real world counter part. Our simulationresults indicate an inverse-U pattern between housing price-to-rent ratio andmeasures of income inequality, and as well as a U-shape pattern between price-to-rent ratio and social mobility measured by Shorrocks Index. The implicationis that housing tends to amplify the inequality and slow down the socialmobility when houses can only be purchased by a small group of agents in theeconomy. Moreover, our results also suggest that better quality of education asa result of a higher return to human capital investment tends to dampen the roleof housing.Keywords:Income Inequality, Social Mobility, Price-to-rent ratio

Abstract:Cryptocurrencies are becoming an attractive asset class and are the focus ofrecent quantitative research. The joint dynamics of the cryptocurrency marketyields information on network risk. Utilizing the adaptive LASSO approach, webuild a dynamic network of cryptocurrencies and model the latent communitieswith a dynamic stochastic blockmodel. We develop a dynamic covariate-assistedspectral clustering method to uniformly estimate the latent group membership ofcryptocurrencies consistently. We show that return inter-predictability andcrypto characteristics, including hashing algorithms and proof types, jointlydetermine the crypto market segmentation. Based on this classification result,it is natural to employ eigenvector centrality to identify a cryptocurrency’sidiosyncratic risk. An asset pricing analysis finds that a cross-sectionalportfolio with a higher centrality earns a higher risk premium. Further testsconfirm that centrality serves as a risk factor well and delivers valuableinformation content on cryptocurrency markets.Keywords:Community Detection, Dynamic Stochastic Blockmodel, Spectral Clustering, NodeCovariate, Return Predictability, Portfolio Management

Abstract:Risk transmission among financial markets and their participants is time-evolving, especially for the extreme risk scenarios. Possibly sudden timevariation of such risk structures ask for quantitative technology that is ableto cope with such situations. Here we present a novel localized multivariateCAViaR-type model to respond to the challenge of time-varying risk contagion.For this purpose a local adaptive approach determines homogeneous, low riskvariation intervals at each time point. Critical values for this technique arecalculated via multiplier bootstrap, and the statistical properties of this“localized multivariate CAViaR” are derived. A comprehensive simulation studysupports the effectiveness of our approach in detecting structural change inmultivariate CAViaR. Finally, when applying for the US and German financialmarkets, we can trace out the dynamic tail risk spillovers and find that the USmarket appears to play dominate role in risk transmissions, especially involatile market periods.Keywords:conditional quantile autoregression, local parametric approach, change pointdetection, multiplier bootstrap

Abstract:Understanding the topological structure of real world networks is of hugeinterest in a variety of fields. One of the way to investigate this structure isto find the groups of densely connected nodes called communities. This paperpresents a new non-parametric method of community detection in networks calledAdaptive Weights Community Detection. The idea of the algorithm is to associatea local community for each node. On every iteration the algorithm tests ahypothesis that two nodes are in the same community by comparing their localcommunities. The test rejects the hypothesis if the density of edges betweenthese two local communities is lower than the density inside each one. Adetailed performance analysis of the method shows its dominance over state-of-the-art methods on well known artificial and real world benchmarks.Keywords:Adaptive weights, Gap coefficient, Graph clustering, Nonparametric, Overlappingcommunities

Abstract:This paper provides a detailed framework for modeling portfolios, achieving thehighest growth rate under subjective risk constraints such as Value at Risk(VaR) in the presence of stable laws. Although the maximization of the expectedlogarithm of wealth induces outperforming any other significantly differentstrategy, the Kelly Criterion implies larger bets than a risk-averse investorwould accept. Restricting the Kelly optimization by spectral risk measures, theauthors provide a generalized mapping for different measures of growth andsecurity. Analyzing over 30 years of S&P 500 returns for different samplingfrequencies, the authors find evidence for leptokurtic behavior for allrespective sampling frequencies. Given that lower sampling frequencies imply asmaller number of data points, this paper argues in favor of α-stable laws andits scaling behavior to model financial market returns for a given horizon in ani.i.d. world. Instead of simulating from the class of elliptically stabledistributions, a nonparametric scaling approximation, based on the data-setitself, is proposed. Our paper also uncovers that including long put optionsinto the portfolio optimization, improves the growth criterion for a givensecurity level, leading to a new Kelly portfolio providing the highest geometricmean.Keywords:growth-optimal, Kelly criterion, protective put, portfolio optimization, stabledistribution, Value at Risk

Abstract:Weekly, quarterly and yearly risk measures are crucial for risk reportingaccording to Basel III and Solvency II. For the respective data frequencies, theauthors show in a simulation and backtest study that available data series arenot sufficient in order to estimate Value at Risk and Expected Shortfallsufficiently, given confidence levels of 99.9% and 99.99%. Accordingly, thispaper presents a semi-parametric estimation method, rescaling data from high- tolow-frequency which allows to obtain significantly more data points for theestimation of the respective risk measures. The presented methodology in theα-stable framework, which is able to mimic multifractal behavior in assetreturns, provides tail events which never occurred in the original low-frequencydataset.Keywords:high-frequency, multifractal, stable distribution, rescaling, risk management,Value at Risk, quantile distribution

Abstract:This work aims to investigate the (inter)relations of information arrival, newssentiment, volatilities and jump dynamics of intraday returns. Two parametricGARCH-type jump models which explicitly incorporate both news arrival and newssentiment variables are proposed, among which one assumes news affectingfinancial markets through the jump component while the other postulating theGARCH component channel. In order to give the most-likely format of theinteractions between news arrival and stock market behaviors, these two modelsare compared with several other easier versions of GARCH-type models based onthe calibration results on DJIA 30 stocks. The necessity to include newsprocesses in intraday stock volatility modeling is justified in our specificcalibration samples (2008 and 2013, respectively). While it is not as profitableto model jump process separately as using simpler GARCH process with errordistribution capable to capture fat tail behaviors of financial time series. Inconclusion, our calibration results suggest GARCH-news model with skew-tinnovation distribution as the best candidate for intraday returns of largestocks in US market, which means one can probably avoid the complicatedness ofmodelling jump behavior by using a simplier skew-t error distribution assumptioninstead, but it’s necessary to incorporate news variables.Keywords:information arrival, volatility modeling, jump, sentiment, GARCH

Abstract:Excessive house price growth was at the heart of the financial crisis i07/08. Since then, many countries have added cooling measures to theirregulatory frameworks. It has been found that these measures can indeed controlprice growth, but no one has examined whether this has adverse consequences forthe housing wealth distribution. We examine this for Singapore, which started i09 to target price growth over ten rounds in total. We find that welfare fromhousing wealth in the last round might not be higher than before 2009. Thisdepends on the deflator used to convert nominal into real prices. Irrespectiveof the deflator, we can reject that welfare increased monotonically over thedifferent rounds.Keywords:house price distribution, stochastic dominance tests

Abstract:Second-hand car markets contribute to billions of Euro turnover each year buthardly generate profit for used car dealers. The paper examines the potential ofsophisticated data-driven pricing systems to enhance supplier-side decision-making and escape the zero-profit-trap. Profit maximization requires an accurateunderstanding of demand. The paper identifies factors that characterize consumerdemand and proposes a framework to estimate demand functions using survivalanalysis. Empirical analysis of a large data set of daily used car sales betwee08 to 2012 confirm the merit of the new factors. Observed results also showthe value of survival analysis to explain and predict demand. Random survivalforest emerges as the most suitable vehicle to develop price response functionsas input for a dynamic pricing system.Keywords:Automotive Industry, Price Optimization, Survival Analysis, Dynamic Pricing

Abstract: A copula model with flexibly specified dependence structure can be useful to capture the complexity and heterogeneity in economic and financial time series. However, there exists little methodological guidance for the specification process using copulas. This paper contributes to fill this gap by considering the recently proposed single-index copulas, for which we propose a simultaneous estimation and variable selection procedure. The proposed method allows to choose the most relevant state variables from a comprehensive set using a penalized estimation, and we derive its large sample properties. Simulation results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method in selecting the appropriate state variables and estimating the unknown index coefficients and dependence parameters. An application of the new procedure identifies six macroeconomic driving factors for the dependence among U.S. housing markets.

Abstract The estimation of a causal parameter in a high-dimensional setting where the functions are potentially complex is a challenging task. Parametric and linear modelling is not sufficient to generate unbiased and consistent estimators. Modern approaches, therefore, use machine learning (ML) algorithms to learn these nuisance functions. However, this leads to new problems like the regularization bias or overfitting that are common when using ML models. This paper considers different novel methods that overcome these problems or at least address them. These methods differ in terms of the target parameter, namely the average treatment effect of the population, group heterogeneity or the conditional average treatment effect for each individual. Each method is first investigated and tested separately and second, they are compared among each other. To do this in a disciplined manner, simulations with synthetic data are used. This ensures that all distributions of the generated treatment effect parameters are known. The findings are that each method has its limits in terms of unbiased estimation, the detection of heterogeneity and also the determination of which covariates are responsible for different causal effects.

Abstract Uplift modeling combines machine learning and experimental strategies to estimate the differential effect of a treatment on individuals behavior. The paper considers uplift models in the scope of marketing campaign targeting. Literature on uplift modeling strategies is fragmented across academic disciplines and lacks an overarching empirical comparison. Using data from online retailers, we fill this gap and contribute to literature through consolidating prior work on uplift modeling and systematically comparing the predictive performance and utility of available uplift modeling strategies. Our empirical study includes three experiments in which we examine the interaction between an uplift modeling strategy and the underlying machine learning algorithm to implement the strategy, quantify model performance in terms of business value and demonstrate the advantages of uplift models over response models, which are widely used in marketing. The results facilitate making specific recommendations how to deploy uplift models in e-commerce applications.

Asymptotic properties are presented for sample RINFIN that is successful in extracting indications for in uential and bad leverage cases in microarray data and simulated, high dimensional data. Its performance improves as p increases and can also be used in multiple response linear regression. RINFIN's advantage is that, whereas in in uence functions of -regression coecients each x-coordinate and r(x; y) appear in a sum as product with moderate size when (x; y) is bad leverage case and masking makes r(x; y) nearly vanish, RINFIN's x-partial derivatives convert the product in sum allowing for unmasking.

Abstract High-dimensional, streaming datasets are ubiquitous in modern applications. Examples range from nance and e-commerce to the study of biomedical and neuroimaging data. As a result, many novel algorithms have been proposed to address challenges posed by such datasets. In this work, we focus on the use of - regularized linear models in the context of (possibly non-stationary) streaming data. Recently, it has been noted that the choice of the regularization parameter is fundamental in such models and several methods have been proposed which iteratively tune such a parameter in a time-varying manner, thereby allowing the underlying sparsity of estimated models to vary. Moreover, in many applications, inference on the regularization parameter may itself be of interest, as such a parameter is related to the underlying sparsity of the model. However, in this work, we highlight and provide extensive empirical evidence regarding how various (often unrelated) statistical properties in the data can lead to changes in the regularization parameter. In particular, through various synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that changes in the regularization parameter may be driven by changes in the true underlying sparsity, signal-to-noise ratio or even model misspecication. The purpose of this letter is, therefore, to highlight and catalog various statistical properties which induce changes in the associated regularization parameter. We conclude by presenting two applications: one relating to nancial data and another to neuroimaging data, where the aforementioned discussion is relevant.

Abstract The market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has risen rapidly during the last few years. Despite their high volatility, this fact has spurred growing interest in cryptocurrencies as an alternative investment asset for portfolio and risk management. We characterise the effects of adding cryptocurrencies in addition to traditional assets to the set of eligible assets in portfolio management. Out-of-sample performance and diversification benefits are studied for the most popular portfolio-construction rules, including mean-variance optimization, risk-parity, and maximum-diversification strategies, as well as combined strategies.  To account for the frequently low liquidity of cryptocurrency markets we incorporate the LIBRO method, which gives suitable liquidity constraints. Our results show that cryptocurrencies can improve the risk-return profile of portfolios. In particular, cryptocurrencies are more useful for portfolio strategies with higher target returns; they do not play a role in minimum-variance portfolios. However, a maximum-diversification strategy (maximising the Portfolio Diversification Index, PDI) draws appreciably on cryptocurrencies, and spanning tests clearly indicate that cryptocurrency returns are non-redundant additions to the investment universe.

Abstract Modeling the joint tails of multiple nancial time series has important im- plications for risk management. Classical models for dependence often encounter a lack of t in the joint tails, calling for additional  exibility. In this paper we introduce a new nonparametric time-varying mixture copula model, in which both weights and depen- dence parameters are deterministic functions of time. We propose penalized trending mixture copula models with group smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penal- ty functions to do the estimation and copula selection simultaneously. Monte Carlo simulation results suggest that the shrinkage estimation procedure performs well in s- electing and estimating both constant and trending mixture copula models. Using the proposed model and method, we analyze the evolution of the dependence among four international stock markets, and nd substantial changes in the levels and patterns of the dependence, in particular around crisis periods.

Abstract In this paper we investigate the statistical properties of cryptocurrencies by using alpha-stable distributions. We also study the benefits of the Metcalfe's law (the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system) for the evaluation of cryptocurrencies. As the results showed a potential for herding behaviour, we used LPPL models to capture the behaviour of cryptocurrencies exchange rates during an endogenous bubble and to predict the most probable time of the regime switching.

Abstract An extensive empirical literature documents a generally negative relation, named the leverage effect, between asset returns and changes of volatility. It is more challenging to establish such a return-volatility relationship for jumps in high-frequency data. We propose new nonparametric methods to assess and test for a discontinuous leverage effect  i.e. a covariation between contemporaneous jumps in prices and volatility. The methods are robust to market microstructure noise and build on a newly developed price-jump localization and estimation procedure. Our empirical investigation of six years of transaction data from 320 NASDAQ firms displays no unconditional negative covariation between price and volatility cojumps. We show, however, that there is a strong and significant discontinuous leverage effect if one conditions on the sign of price jumps and whether the price jumps are market-wide or idiosyncratic.

Abstract Open-ended responses are widely used in market research studies. Processing of such responses requires labor-intensive human coding. This paper focuses on unsupervised topic models and tests their ability to automate the analysis of open-ended responses. Since state-ofthe- art topic models struggle with the shortness of open-ended responses, the paper considers three novel short text topic models: Latent Feature Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Biterm Topic Model and Word Network Topic Model. The models are fitted and evaluated on a set of realworld open-ended responses provided by a market research company. Multiple components such as topic coherence and document classification are quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated to appraise whether topic models can replace human coding. The results suggest that topic models are a viable alternative for open-ended response coding. However, their usefulness is limited when a correct one-to-one mapping of responses and topics or the exact topic distribution is needed.

Abstract This paper studies the short-run impacts of temperature on human performance in the computer-mediated environment using server logs of a popular online game in China. Taking advantage of the quasi-experiment of winter central heating policy inChina, we distinguish the impacts of outdoor and indoor temperature and find that low temperatures below 5 ?C decrease game performance significantly. Non-experienced players suffered larger performance drop than experienced ones. Access to central heating attenuates negative impacts of low outdoor temperatures on gamers performance. High temperatures above 21 ?C also lead to drops in game performance.We conclude that expanding the current central heating zone will bring an increase in human performance by approximately 4% in Shanghai and surrounding provinces in the winter. While often perceived as a leisure activity, online gaming requires intense engagement and the deployment of cognitive, social, and motor skills, which are also key skills for productive activities. Our results draw attention to potential damages of extreme temperature on human performance in the modern computer-mediated environment.

Abstract In this article, we study a nonparametric approach regarding a general nonlinear reduced form equation to achieve a better approximation of the optimal instrument. Accordingly, we propose the nonparametric additive instrumental variable estimator (NAIVE) with the adaptive group Lasso.We theoretically demonstrate that the proposed estimator is root-n consistent and asymptotically normal. The adaptive group Lasso helps us select the valid instruments while the dimensionality of potential instrumental variables is allowed to be greater than the sample size. In practice, the degree and knots of B-spline series are selected by minimizing the BIC or EBIC criteria for each nonparametric additive component in the reduced form equation. In Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the NAIVE has the same performance as the linear instrumental variable (IV) estimator for the truly linear reduced form equation. On the other hand, the NAIVE performs much better in terms of bias and mean squared errors compared to other alternative estimators under the high-dimensional nonlinear reduced form equation. We further illustrate our method in an empirical study of international trade and growth. Our findings provide  Keywords:  Adaptive group Lasso; Instrumental variables; Nonparametric additive model; Optimal estimator; Variable selection.

Abstract The conventional wisdom that housing prices are the present value of future rents ignores the fact that unlike dividends on stocks, rent is not discretionary. Housing price uncertainty can affect household property investments, which in turn affect rent. By extending the theory of investment under uncertainty, we model the renters decision to buy a house and the landlords decision to sell as the exercising of real options of waiting and examine real options effects on rent. Using data from Hong Kong and mainland China, we find a significant effect of housing price on rent and draw important policy implications.  Keywords:

Abstract This paper is concerned with selecting important covariates and estimating the index direction simultaneously for high dimensional single-index models. We develop an efficient Threshold Gradient Directed Regularization method via maximizing Distance Covariance (DC-TGDR) between the single index and response variable. Due to the appealing property of distance covariance which can measure nonlinear dependence between random variables, the proposed method avoids estimating the unknown link function of the single index and dramatically reduces computational complexity compared to other methods that use smoothing techniques. It keeps the model-free advantage from the view of sufficient dimension reduction and requires neither predictors nor response variable to be continuous. In addition, the DC-TGDR method encourages a grouping effect. That is, it is capable of choosing highly correlated covariates in or out of the model together. We examine finite-sample performance of the proposed method by Monte Carlo simulations. In a real data analysis, we identify important copy number alterations (CNAs) for gene expression.

Abstract In this article we develop a tractable procedure for testing strict stationarity in a double autoregressive model and formulate the problem as testing if the top Lyapunov exponent is negative. Without strict stationarity assumption, we construct a consistent estimator of the associated top Lyapunov exponent and employ a random weighting approach for its variance estimation, which in turn are used in a t-type test. We also propose a GLAD estimation for parameters of interest, relaxing key assumptions on the commonly used QMLE. All estimators, except for the intercept, are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal in both stationary and explosive situations. The nite-sample performance of the proposed procedures is evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation studies and a real dataset of interest rates is analyzed.

Abstract In this paper, we propose a new class of regime shift models with flexible switching mechanism that relies on a nonparametric probability function of the observed threshold variables. The proposed models generally embrace traditional threshold models with contaminated threshold variables or heterogeneous threshold values, thus gaining more power in handling complicated data structure. We solve the identification issue by imposing either global shape restriction or boundary condition on the nonparametric probability function. We utilize the natural connection between penalized splines and hierarchical Bayes to conduct smoothing. By adopting different priors, our procedure could work well for estimations of smooth curve as well as discontinuous curves with occasionally structural breaks. Bayesian tests for the existence of threshold effects are also conducted based on the posterior samples from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Both simulation studies and an empirical application in predicting the U.S. stock market returns demonstrate the validity of our methods.

Abstract In this article, we propose a new class of semiparametric instrumental variable models with partially varying coefficients, in which the structural function has a partially linear form and the impact of endogenous structural variables can vary over different levels of some exogenous variables. We propose a three-step estimation procedure to estimate both functional and constant coefficients. The consistency and asymptotic normality of these proposed estimators are established. Moreover, a generalized F-test is developed to test whether the functional coefficients are of particular parametric forms with some underlying economic intuitions, and furthermore, the limiting distribution of the proposed generalized F-test statistic under the null hypothesis is established. Finally, we illustrate the finite sample performance of our approach with simulations and two real data examples in economics.

Abstract We model the term structure of implied volatility (TSIV) with an adaptive approach to improve predictability, which treats dynamic time series models of globally time- varying but locally constant parameters and uses a data-driven procedure to ?nd the local optimal interval. We choose two speci?cations of the adaptive models: a simple local AR (LAR) model for a univariate implied volatility series and an adaptive dynamic Nelson-Siegel (ADNS) model of three factors, each based on an LAR, to model the cross- section of the TSIV simultaneously with parsimony. Both LAR and ADNS models uniformly outperform more than a dozen alternative models with signi?cance across maturities for 1-20 day forecast horizons. Measured by RMSE and MAE, the forecast errors of the random walk model can be reduced by between 20% and 60% for the 5 to 20 days ahead forecast. In terms of prediction accuracy of future directional changes, the adaptive models achieve an accuracy range of 60%-90%, which strictly dominates the range of 30%-59% of the alternative models.

Abstract A trading rule that draws on the empirical similarity concept is proposed to simulate the technical trading mentality|one that selectively perceives structural resemblances between market scenarios of the present and the past. In more than half of the nineteen futures markets that we test against for protability of this similarity-based trading rule, we nd evidence of predictive ability that is robust to data-snooping and transaction-cost adjust- ments. When aided by an exit strategy that liquidates the trader's positions across some evenly-spaced time points, this rule generates the most robust returns.

Abstract Cryptocurrencies refer to a type of digital cash that use distributed ledger - or blockchain technology - to provide secure transactions. These currencies are generally misunderstood. While initially dismissed as fads or bubbles, many large central banks are considering launching their own version of national cryptocurrencies. In contrast to most data in nancial economics, there is a plethora of detailed (free) data on the history of every transaction for the cryptocurrency complex. Further, there is little empirically-oriented research on this new asset class. This is an extraordinary research opportunity for academia. We provide a starting point by giving an insight into cryptocurrency mechanisms and detailing summary statistics and focusing on potential future research avenues in nancial economics.

Abstract News move markets and contains incremental information about stock reactions. Future trading volumes, volatility and returns are a ected by sentiments of texts and opinions expressed in articles. Earlier work of sentiment distillation of stock news suggests that risk prole reactions might differ across sectors. Conventional asset pricing theory recognizes the role of a sector and its risk uniqueness that differs from market or rm specic risk. Our research assesses whether incorporating the sentiment distilled from sector specic news carries information about risk proles. Textual analytics applied to about 600K articles leads us with lexical projection and machine learning to classication of sentiment polarities. The texts are scraped from offcial NASDAQ web pages and with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as tokenization, lemmatization, a sector specic sentiment is extracted using a lexical approach and a nancial phrase bank. Predicted sentence-level polarities are aggregated into a bullishness measure on a daily basis and fed into a panel regression analysis with sector indicators. Supervised learning with hinge or logistic loss and regularization yields good prediction results of polarity. Compared with standard lexical projections, the supervised learning approach yields superior predictions of sentiment, leading to highly sector specic sentiment reactions. The Consumer Staples, Health Care and Materials sectors show strong risk prole reactions to negative polarity.

Abstract In the present paper we propose a new method, the Penalized Adaptive Method (PAM), for a data driven detection of structural changes in sparse linear models. The method is able to allocate the longest homogeneous intervals over the data sample and simultaneously choose the most proper variables with the help of penalized regression models. The method is simple yet  exible and can be safely applied in high-dimensional cases with dierent sources of parameter changes. Comparing with the adaptive method in linear models, its combination with dimension reduction yields a method which properly selects signicant variables and detects structural breaks while steadily reduces the forecast error in high-dimensional data.

Abstract Starting from well-known empirical stylised facts of nancial time series, we develop dynamic portfolio protection trading strategies based on econometric methods. As a criterion for riskiness we consider the evolution of the value-at-risk spread from a GARCH model with normal innovations relative to a GARCH model with generalised innovations. These generalised innovations may for example follow a Student t, a generalised hyperbolic (GH), an alpha-stable or a Generalised Pareto (GPD) distribution. Our results indicate that the GPD distribution provides the strongest signals for avoiding tail risks. This is not surprising as the GPD distribution arises as a limit of tail behaviour in extreme value theory and therefore is especially suited to deal with tail risks. Out-of-sample backtests on 11 years of DAX futures data, indicate that the dynamic tail-risk protection strategy eectively reduces the tail risk while outperforming traditional portfolio protection strategies. The results are further validated by calculating the statistical signicance of the results obtained using bootstrap methods. A number of robustness tests including application to other assets further underline the eectiveness of the strategy. Finally, by empirically testing for second order stochastic dominance, we nd that risk averse investors would be willing to pay a positive premium to move from a static buy-and-hold investment in the DAX future to the tail-risk protection strategy.

Abstract We investigate default probabilities and default correlations of Merton-type credit portfolio models in stress scenarios where a common risk factor is truncated. The analysis is performed in the class of elliptical distributions, a family of light-tailed to heavy-tailed distributions encompassing many distributions commonly found in nancial modelling. It turns out that the asymptotic limit of default probabilities and default correlations depend on the max-domain of the elliptical distribution's mixing variable. In case the mixing variable is regularly varying, default probabilities are strictly smaller than 1 and default correlations are in (0; 1). Both can be expressed in terms of the Student t-distribution function. In the rapidly varying case, default probabilities are 1 and default correlations are 0. We compare our results to the tail dependence function and discuss implications for credit portfolio modelling.

Abstract Paralleling regulatory developments, we devise value-at-risk and expected shortfall type risk measures for the potential losses arising from using misspecied models when pricing and hedging contingent claims. Essentially, losses from model risk correspond to losses realized on a perfectly hedged position. Model uncertainty is expressed by a set of pricing models, relative to which potential losses are determined. Using market data, a unied loss distribution is attained by weighing models according to a relative likelihood criterion. Examples demonstrate the magnitude of model risk and corresponding capital buers necessary to suciently protect trading book positions against unexpected losses from model risk.

Abstract We investigate correlations of asset returns in stress scenarios where a common risk factor is truncated. Our analysis is performed in the class of normal variance mixture (NVM) models, which encompasses many distributions commonly used in nancial modelling. For the special cases of jointly normally and t-distributed asset returns we derive closed formulas for the correlation under stress. For the NVM distribution, we calculate the asymptotic limit of the correlation under stress, which depends on whether the variables are in the maximum domain of attraction of the Frechet or Gumbel distribution. It turns out that correlations in heavy-tailed NVM models are less sensitive to stress than in medium- or light-tailed models. Our analysis sheds light on the suitability of this model class to serve as a quantitative framework for stress testing, and as such provides valuable information for risk and capital management in nancial institutions, where NVM models are frequently used for assessing capital adequacy. We also demonstrate how our results can be applied for more prudent stress testing.

Abstract In 2012, JPMorgan accumulated a USD 6.2 billion loss on a credit derivatives portfolio, the so-called \London Whale", partly as a consequence of de-correlations of non-perfectly correlated positions that were supposed to hedge each other. Motivated by this case, we devise a factor model for correlations that allows for scenario-based stress-testing of correlations. We derive a number of analytical results related to a portfolio of homogeneous assets. Using the concept of Mahalanobis distance, we show how to identify adverse scenarios of correlation risk. As an example, we apply the factor-model approach to the \London Whale" portfolio and determine the value-at-risk impact from correlation changes. Since our ndings are particularly relevant for large portfolios, where even small correlation changes can have a large impact, a further application would be to stress-test portfolios of central counterparties, which are of systemically relevant size.

Abstract In a continuous-time setting where a risk-averse agent controls the drift of an output process driven by a Brownian motion, optimal contracts are linear in the terminal output; this result is well-known in a setting with moral hazard and  under stronger assumptions  adverse selection. We show that this result continues to hold when in addition reser- vation utilities are type-dependent.

Abstract In this paper, we study the latent group structure in cryptocurrencies market by forming a dynamic return inferred network with coin attributions. We develop a dynamic covariate-assisted spectral clustering method to detect the communities in dynamic network framework and prove its uniform consistency along the horizons. Applying our new method, we show the return inferred network structure and coin attributions, including algorithm and proof types, jointly determine the market segmentation. Based on the network model, we propose a novel \hard-to-value" measure using the centrality scores. Further analysis reveals that the group with a lower centrality score exhibits stronger short-term return reversals. Cross-sectional return predictability further conrms the economic meanings of our grouping results and reveal important portfolio management implications.

Abstract In this work, we propose to define Gaussian Processes indexed by multidimensional distributions. In the framework where the distributions can be modeled as i.i.d realizations of a measure on the set of distributions, we prove that the kernel defined as the quadratic distance between the transportation maps, that transport each distribution to the barycenter of the distributions, provides a valid covariance function. In this framework, we study the asymptotic properties of this process, proving micro ergodicity of the parameters.   Keywords:  Gaussian Process, Kernel methods, Wasserstein Distance

Abstract We consider a problem of multiclass classification, where the training sample Sn = {(Xi, Yi)}n i=1 is generated from the model P(Y = m|X = x) = m(x), 1 6 m 6 M, and 1(x), . . . , M(x) are unknown Lip- schitz functions. Given a test point X, our goal is to estimate 1(X), . . . , M(X). An approach based on nonparametric smoothing uses a localization technique, i.e. the weight of observation (Xi, Yi) depends on the distance between Xi and X. However, local estimates strongly depend on localiz- ing scheme. In our solution we fix several schemes , . . . ,WK, compute corresponding local estimates e(1), . . . , e(K) for each of them and apply an aggregation procedure. We propose an algorithm, which constructs a con- vex combination of the estimates e(1), . . . , e(K) such that the aggregated estimate behaves approximately as well as the best one from the collection e(1), . . . , e(K). We also study theoretical properties of the procedure, prove oracle results and establish rates of convergence under mild assumptions.   Keywords:

Recent papers [20, 23] investigate the asymptotic distribution of the Frobenius distance between the projectors k bPJ ??P J  . The problem arises when one tries to build a condence set for the true projector eectively. We consider the problem from Bayesian perspective and derive an approximation for the posterior distribution of the Frobenius distance between projectors. The derived theorems hold true for non-Gaussian data: the only assumption that we impose is the con- centration of the sample covariance b in a vicinity of  . The obtained results are applied to construction of sharp condence sets for the true pro- jector.

Abstract In this paper, we consider a probabilistic setting where the probability measures are considered to be random objects. We propose a procedure of construction non-asymptotic confidence sets for empirical barycenters in 2 -Wasserstein space and develop the idea further to construction of a non-parametric two-sample test that is then applied to the detection of structural breaks in data with complex geometry. Both procedures mainly rely on the idea of multiplier bootstrap (Spokoiny and Zhilova [29], Chernozhukov, Chetverikov and Kato [13]). The main focus lies on probability measures that have commuting covariance matrices and belong to the same scatter-location family: we proof the validity of a bootstrap procedure that allows to compute confidence sets and critical values for a Wasserstein-based two-sample test.

Recent technique from [9] helps to study the asymp- totic distribution of the distance in the Frobenius norm kPr - bP r between the true projector Pr on the subspace of the rth eigenvalue and its empirical counterpart bP r in terms of the effective rank of . This paper offers a bootstrap procedure for building sharp confidence sets for the true projector Pr from the given data. This procedure does not rely on the asymptotic distribution of kPr - bP r and its moments. It could be applied for small or moderate sample size n and large dimension p. The main result states the validity of the proposed procedure for finite samples with an explicit error bound for the er- ror of bootstrap approximation. This bound involves some new sharp results on Gaussian comparison and Gaussian anti-concentration in high-dimensional spaces. Numeric results confirm a good performance of the method in realistic examples.   Keywords:

Abstract We distill sentiment from a huge assortment of NASDAQ news articles by means of machine learning methods and examine its predictive power in single-stock option markets and equity markets. We provide evidence that single-stock options react to contemporaneous sentiment. Next, examining return predictability, we discover that while option variables indeed predict stock returns, sentiment variables add further informational content. In fact, both in a regression and a trading context, option variables orthogonalized to public and sentimental news are even more informative predictors of stock returns. Distinguishing further between overnight and trading-time news, we find the first to be more informative. From a statistical topic model, we uncover that this is attributable to the differing thematic coverage of the alternate archives. Finally, we show that sentiment disagreement commands a strong positive risk premium above and beyond market volatility and that lagged returns predict future returns in concentrated sentiment environments.

Abstract The New Keynesian theory of inflation determination has been under scrutiny due to identification issues, which rather have to do with the mechanism of inflation determination at its core (i.e. Cochrane (2011)). Moreover, similar identification problems arise in the case of fiscal inflation (see for example Leeper and Leith (2016), Leeper and Li (2017) and Leeper and Walker (2012)). This paper makes a positive contribution. We argue that statements about observational equivalence stem from referring to the equilibrium path, while this should not be our primary source of identifying restrictions. Moreover, policy identification (or lack thereof) relies on assumptions on the underlying shock structure, which is unobservable. We instead extract shocks using heterogeneous uncertain restrictions and external datasets, that is, we learn from errors. We are then able to recover deep and policy parameters irrespective of the prevailing equilibrium. We provide time varying evidence on the efficacy of policy in stabilizing the US economy and on the time varying plausibility of Ricardian versus non-Ricardian price determination. Results are work in progress.   Keywords:  Monetary and fiscal policy, Price Determination, Identification, Learning from errors

Abstract We consider the estimation and inference in a system of high-dimensional regression equations allowing for temporal and cross-sectional dependency in covariates and error processes, covering rather general forms of weak dependence. A sequence of large-scale regressions with LASSO is applied to reduce the dimensionality, and an overall penalty level is carefully chosen by a block multiplier bootstrap procedure to account for multiplicity of the equations and dependencies in the data. Correspondingly, oracle properties with a jointly selected tuning parameter are derived. We further provide high-quality de-biased simultaneous inference on the many target parameters of the system. We provide bootstrap consistency results of the test procedure, which are based on a general Bahadur representation for the Z-estimators with dependent data. Simulations demonstrate good performance of the proposed inference procedure. Finally, we apply the method to quantify spillover effects of textual sentiment indices in a financial market and to test the connectedness among sectors.

Abstract Given data y and k covariates xj one problem in linear regression is to decide which if any of the covariates to include when regressing the dependent variable y on the covariates xj . In this paper three such methods, lasso, knockoff and Gaussian covariates are compared using simulations and real data. The Gaussian covariate method is based on exact probabilities which are valid for all y and xj making it model free. Moreover the probabilities agree with those based on the F-distribution for the standard linear model with i.i.d. Gaussian errors. It is conceptually, mathematically and algorithmically very simple, it is very fast and makes no use of simulations. It outperforms lasso and knockoff in all respects by a considerable margin.

Abstract This paper presents a new approach to non-parametric cluster analysis called Adaptive Weights Clustering (AWC). The idea is to identify the clustering structure by checking at different points and for dierent scales on departure from local homogeneity. The proposed procedure describes the clustering structure in terms of weights wij each of them measures the degree of local inhomogeneity for two neighbor local clusters using statistical tests of \no gap" between them. The procedure starts from very local scale, then the parameter of locality grows by some factor at each step. The method is fully adaptive and does not require to specify the number of clusters or their structure. The clustering results are not sensitive to noise and outliers, the procedure is able to recover dierent clusters with sharp edges or manifold structure. The method is scalable and computationally feasible. An intensive numerical study shows a state-of-the-art performance of the method in various articial examples and applications to text data. Our theoretical study states optimal sensitivity of AWC to local inhomogeneity.   Keywords:  adaptive weights, clustering, gap coecient, manifold clustering

Abstract Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are establishing themselves as an investment asset and are often named the New Gold. This study, however, shows that the two assets could barely be more dierent. Firstly, we analyze and compare conditional variance properties of Bitcoin and Gold as well as other assets and nd dierences in their structure. Secondly, we implement a BEKK-GARCH model to estimate time-varying conditional correlations. Gold plays an important role in nancial markets with  ight-to-quality in times of market distress. Our results show that Bitcoin behaves as the exact opposite and it positively correlates with downward markets. Lastly, we analyze the properties of Bitcoin as portfolio component and nd no evidence for hedging capabilities. We conclude that Bitcoin and Gold feature fundamentally dierent properties as assets and linkages to equity markets. Our results hold for the broad cryptocurrency index CRIX. As of now, Bitcoin does not re ect any distinctive properties of Gold other than asymmetric response in variance.

Abstract Trading of Bitcoin is spread about multiple venues where buying and selling is offered in various currencies. However, all markets trade one common good and by the law of one price, the different prices should not deviate in the long run. In this context we are interested in which platform is the most important one in terms of price discovery. To this end, we use a pairwise approach accounting for a potential impact of exchange rates. The contribution to price discovery is measured by Hasbrouck's and Gonzalo and Granger's information share. We then derive an ordering with respect to the importance of each market which reveals that the Chinese OKCoin platform is the leader in price discovery of Bitcoin, followed by BTC China.

Abstract Data from social media has created opportunities to understand how and why people move through their urban environment and how this relates to criminal activity. To aid resource allocation decisions in the scope of predictive policing, the paper proposes an approach to predict weekly crime counts. The novel approach captures spatial dependency of criminal activity through approximating human dynamics. It integrates point of interest data in the form of Foursquare venues with Twitter activity and taxi trip data, and introduces a set of approaches to create features from these data sources. Empirical results demonstrate the explanatory and predictive power of the novel features. Analysis of a six-month period of real-world crime data for the city of New York evidences that both temporal and static features are necessary to eectively account for human dynamics and predict crime counts accurately. Furthermore, results provide new evidence into the underlying mechanisms of crime and give implications for crime analysis and intervention.

Abstract Marketing messages are most effective if they reach the right customers. Deciding which customers to contact is thus an important task in campaign planning. The paper focuses on empirical targeting models. We argue that common practices to develop such models do not account sufficiently for business goals. To remedy this, we propose profit-conscious ensemble selection, a modeling framework that integrates statistical learning principles and business objectives in the form of campaign profit maximization. The results of a comprehensive empirical study confirm the business value of the proposed approach in that it recommends substantially more profitable target groups than several benchmarks.

Abstract New Public Management helps universities and research institutions to perform in a highly competitive research environment. Evaluating publicly financed research results improves transparency, helps in reflection and self-assessment, and provides information for strategic decision making. In this paper we provide empirical evidence using data from a Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) on financial inputs and research output from 2005 to 2016. After selecting performance indicators suitable for a CRC, we describe main properties of the data using visualization techniques. To study the relationship between the dimensions of research performance, we use a time fixed effects panel data model and fixed effects Poisson model. With the help of year dummy variables, we show how the pattern of research productivity changed over time after controlling for staff and travel costs. The joint depiction of the time fixed effects and the research projects life cycle allows a better understanding of the development of the number of discussion papers over time.

The paper analyses day-ahead price dynamics on some of these new markets and in Germany as a benchmark of a completely decentralized Western European market. To that end, several price forecasting methods including autoregressive approaches, multiple linear regression, and neural networks are considered. These methods are tested on hourly day-ahead price data during four two-week periods corresponding to different seasons and varying levels of volatility in all selected markets. The most influential fundamental factors are determined and performance of forecasting techniques is analysed with respect to the age of the market, its degree of liberalization, and the level of volatility. A comparison of Southeast European electricity markets of different age with the older German market is made and clusters of similar Southeast European markets are identified.

Abstract The recent emergence of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies has received a considerable attention. The growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies has led many to speculate that the blockchain technology can surpass a traditional centralized monetary system. However, no monetary model has yet been de- veloped to study the economics of the blockchain. This paper builds a model of the economy with a single generally acepted blockchain-based currency. In the spirit of the search and matching literature I use a matching function to model the operation of the blockchain. The formulation of the money demand is taken from a workhorse of monetary economics - Lagos and Wright (2005). I show that in a blockchain-based monetary system money demand features a precautionary motive which is absent in the standard Lagos-Wright model. Due to this precautionary money demand the monetary equilibrium can be stable for some calibrations. I also used the developed model to study how the equilibrium return on money is  Keywords:  Blockchain, Miners, Cryptocurrency, Matching function

Abstract We link the hiring of R&D scientists from industry competitors to the subsequent formation of collaborative agreements, namely technology-oriented alliances. By transferring technological knowledge as well as cognitive elements to the hiring firm, mobile inventors foster the alignment of decision frames applied by potential alliance partners in the process of alliance formation thereby making collaboration more likely. Using data on inventor mobility and alliance formation amongst 42 global pharmaceutical firms over 16 years, we show that inventor mobility is positively associated with the likelihood of alliance formation in periods following inventor movements. This relationship becomes more pronounced if mobile employees bring additional knowledge about their prior firms technological capabilities and for alliances aimed at technology development rather than for agreements related to technology transfer. It is weakened, however, if the focal firm is already familiar with the competitors technological capabilities. By revealing these relationships, our study contributes to research on alliance formation, employee mobility, and organizational frames.   Keywords:    JEL classication:

Abstract The recent development of private cryptocurrencies has created a need to extend existing models of private currency provision and currency competi- tion. The outcome of cryptocurrency competition should be analyzed in a model which incorporates important features of the modern cryptocurren- cies. In this paper I focus on two such features. First, cryptocurrencies operate according to a protocol - a blockchain - and are, therefore, free from the time-inconsistency problem. Second, the operation of the blockchain costs real resources. I use the Lagos-Wright search theoretic monetary model augmented with privately issued currencies as in Fernandez-Villaverde and Sanches (2016) and extend it by linear costs of private currency circulation. I show that in contrast to Fernandez-Villaverde and Sanches (2016) cryptocur- rency competition 1) does not deliver price stability and 2) puts downward pressure on the in ation in the public currency only when the costs private currency circulation (mining costs) are suciently low.

Testing for bubbles in cryptocurrencies with time-varying volatility Christian M. Hafner Abstract The recent evolution of cryptocurrencies has been characterized by bubble-like behavior and extreme volatility. While it is difficult to assess an intrinsic value to a specific cryptocurrency, one can employ recently proposed bubble tests that rely on recursive applications of classical unit root tests. This paper extends this approach to the case where volatility is time varying, assuming a deterministic longrun component that may take into account a decrease of unconditional volatility when the cryptocurrency matures with a higher market dissemination. Volatility also includes a stochastic short-run component to capture volatility clustering. The wild bootstrap is shown to correctly adjust the size properties of the bubble test, which retains good power properties. In an empirical application using eleven of the largest cryptocurrencies and the CRIX index, the general evidence in favor of bubbles is confirmed, but much less pronounced than under constant volatility.

Abstract The CRIX (CRyptocurrency IndeX) has been constructed based on a number of cryptos and provides a high coverage of market liquidity, hu.berlin/crix. The crypto currency market is a new asset market and attracts a lot of investors recently. Surprisingly a market for contingent claims hat not been built up yet. A reason is certainly the lack of pricing tools that are based on solid financial econometric tools. Here a first step towards pricing of derivatives of this new asset class is presented. After a careful econometric pre-analysis we motivate an affine jump diffusion model, i.e., the SVCJ (Stochastic Volatility with Correlated Jumps) model. We calibrate SVCJ by MCMC and obtain interpretable jump processes and then via simulation price options. The jumps present in the cryptocurrency fluctutations are an essential component. Concrete examples are given to establish an OCRIX exchange platform trading options on CRIX.   Keywords:  CRyptocurrency IndeX, CRIX, Bitcoin,Cryptocurrency, SVCJ, Option pricing,OCRIX

Abstract With option-implied volatility indices, we provide a new tool for event studies in a network setting and document systemic risk in the spillover networks across global financial markets. Network linkages are sufficiently asymmetric because the US stock and bond markets play as dominant volatility suppliers to other countries and markets. Shocks from the US generate systemic risk through intensifying volatility spillovers across countries and asset classes. The findings offer new evidence that asymmetric network linkages can lead to sizable aggregate fluctuations and thus potential systemic risk.

Abstract: For multivariate nonparametric regression models, existing variable selection methods with penalization require high-dimensional nonparametric approximations in objective functions. When the dimension is high, none of methods with penalization in the literature are readily available. Also, ranking and screening approaches cannot have selection consistency when iterative algorithms cannot be used due to inefficient nonparametric approximation. In this paper, a novel and easily implemented approach is proposed to make existing methods feasible for selection with no need of nonparametric approximation. Selection consistency can be achieved. As an application to additive regression models, we then suggest a two-stage procedure that separates selection and estimation steps. An adaptive estimation to the smoothness of underlying components can be constructed such that the consistency can be even at parametric rate if the underlying model is really parametric. Simulations are carried out to examine the performance of our method, and a real data example is analyzed for illustration.

Abstract: Appropriate risk management is crucial to ensure the competitiveness of financial institutions and the stability of the economy. One widely used financial risk measure is Value-at-Risk (VaR). VaR estimates based on linear and parametric models can lead to biased results or even underestimation of risk due to time varying volatility, skewness and leptokurtosis of nancial return series. The paper proposes a nonlinear and nonparametric framework to forecast VaR. Mean and volatility are modeled via support vector regression (SVR) where the volatility model is motivated by the standard generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) formulation. Based on this, VaR is derived by applying kernel density estimation (KDE). This approach allows for  exible tail shapes of the profit and loss distribution and adapts for a wide class of tail events. The SVR-GARCH-KDE hybrid is compared to standard, exponential and threshold GARCH models coupled with different error distributions. To examine the performance in different markets, one-day-ahead forecasts are produced for different financial indices. Model evaluation using a likelihood ratio based test framework for interval forecasts indicates that the SVR-GARCH-KDE hybrid performs competitive to benchmark models. Especially models that are coupled with a normal distribution are systematically outperformed.   Keywords: Value-at-Risk, Support Vector Regression, Kernel Density Estimation, GARCH

Abstract: High-frequency data can provide us with a quantity of informa- tion for forecasting, help to calculate and prevent the future risk based on extremes. This tail behaviour is very often driven by ex- ogenous components and may be modelled conditional on other vari- ables. However, many of these phenomena are observed over time, exhibiting non-trivial dynamics and dependencies. We propose a func- tional dynamic factor model to study the dynamics of expectile curves. The complexity of the model and the number of dependent variables are reduced by lasso penalization. The functional factors serve as a low-dimensional representation of the conditional tail event, while the time-variation is captured by factor loadings. We illustrate the model with an application to climatology, where daily data over years on temperature, rainfalls or strength of wind are available.

Abstract: For change-point analysis of high dimensional time series, we consider a semiparametric model with dynamic structural break factors. The observations are described by a few low dimensional factors with time-invariate loading functions of covariates. The unknown structural break in time models the regime switching eects introduced by exogenous shocks. In particular, the factors are assumed to be nonstationary and follow a Vector Autoregression (VAR) process with a structural break. In addition, to account for the known spatial discrepancies, we introduce discrete loading functions. We study the theoretical properties of the estimates of the loading functions and the factors. Moreover, we provide both the consistency and the asymptotic convergence results for making inference on the common breakpoint in time. The estimation precision is evaluated via a simulation study. Finally we present two empirical illustrations on modeling the dynamics of the minimum wage policy in China and analyzing a limit order book dataset.

Abstract: The EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS) was created to reduce the C and other greenhouse gas emissions at the lowest economic cost. In reality market participants are faced with considerable uncertainty due to price changes and require price and volatility estimates and forecasts for appropriate risk management, asset allocation and volatility trading. Although the simplest approach to estimate volatility is to use the historical standard deviation, realized volatility is a more accurate measure for volatility, since it is based on intraday data. Besides the stylized facts commonly observed in financial time series, we observe long-memory properties in the realized volatility series, which motivates the use of Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) class models. Therefore, we propose to model and forecast the realized volatility of the EU ETS futures with HAR class models. The HAR models outperform benchmark models such as the standard long-memory ARFIMA model in terms of model fit, in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting. The analysis is based on intraday data (May 2007-April 2012) for futures on C certificates for the second EU-ETS trading period (expiry December 2008-2012). The estimation results of the models allow to explain the volatility drivers in the market and volatility structure, according to the Heterogeneous Market Hypothesis as well as the observed asymmetries. We see that both speculators with short investment horizons as well as traders taking long-term hedging positions are active in the market. In a simulation study we test the suitability of the HAR model for option pricing and conclude that the HAR model is capable of mimicking the long-term volatility structure in the futures market and can be used for short-term and long-term option pricing.

Abstract: This paper considers a fast and effective algorithm for conducting functional principle component analysis with multivariate factors. Compared with the univariate case, our approach could be more powerful in revealing spatial connections or extracting important features in images. To facilitate fast computation, we connect Singular Value Decomposition with penalized smoothing and avoid estimating a huge dimensional covariance operator. Under regularity assumptions, the results indicate that we may enjoy the optimal convergence rate by employing the smoothness assumption inherent to functional objects. We apply our method on the analysis of brain image data. Our extracted factors provide excellent recovery of the risk related regions of interests in human brain and the estimated loadings are very informative in revealing the individual risk attitude.

Abstract: Dem deutschen Arbeitsmarkt ging es noch nie seit der Wiedervereinigung so gut wie heute. Die nachhaltige Entwicklung seit 2005 ist auf zwei entscheidende Treiber zurückzuführen: die Umverteilung eines beinahe gleichbleibenden Arbeitsstundenvolumens auf mehr Beschäftigte und die massive Ausweitung der Teilzeitarbeit. Die Lohnzurückhaltung der Tarifparteien war dabei eine notwendige, jedoch nicht hinreichende Bedingung für diesen Erfolg. Die Kovarianz von Lohn und Erwerbsindikatoren deutet darauf hin, dass die Arbeitsmarktreformen der sogenannten Agenda 2010 die erwerbsfähige Bevölkerung ab 2005 zur Teilnahme am Arbeitsmarkt aktiviert haben. Insbesondere die Reform der Arbeitslosenunterstützung hat die Ausweitung des Arbeitsangebots im unteren Lohnsegment ermöglicht und bewerkstelligt, dass die sozialversicherungspflichtige Teil- und Vollzeitarbeit zunahm. Ein Rückbau der Reformen könnte diesen Erfolg gefährden. Key Words:  Deutsches Arbeitsmarktwunder, Hartz-Reformen, Lohnungleichheit, Teilzeitbeschäftigung

Abstract: Systemic risk quantification in the current literature is concentrated on market-based methods such as CoVaR(Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016)). Although it is easily implemented, the interactions among the variables of interest and their joint distribution are less addressed. To quantify systemic risk in a system-wide perspective, we propose a network-based factor copula approach to study systemic risk in a network of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). The factor copula model offers a variety of dependencies/tail dependencies conditional on the chosen factor; thus constructing conditional network. Given the network, we identify the most connected SIFI as the central SIFI, and demonstrate that its systemic risk exceeds that of non-central SIFIs. Our identification of central SIFIs shows a coincidence with the bucket approach proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, but places more emphasis on modeling the interplay among SIFIs in order to generate systemwide quantifications. The network defined by the tail dependence matrix is preferable to that defined by the Pearson correlation matrix since it confirms that the identified central SIFI through it severely impacts the system. This study contributes to quantifying and ranking the systemic importance of SIFIs. Key Words:  factor copula, network, Value-at-Risk, tail dependence, eigenvector centrality

Abstract: With increasing wind power penetration more and more volatile and weather dependent energy is fed into the German electricity system. To manage the risk of windless days and transfer revenue risk from wind turbine owners to investors wind power derivatives were introduced. These insurance-like securities (ILS) allow to hedge the risk of unstable wind power production on exchanges like Nasdaq and European Energy Exchange. These products have been priced before using risk neutral pricing techniques. We present a modern and powerful methodology to model weather derivatives with very skewed underlyings incorporating techniques from extreme event modelling to tune seasonal volatility and compare transformed Gaussian and non-Gaussian CARMA(p; q) models. Our results indicate that the transformed Gaussian CARMA(p; q) model is preferred over the non-Gaussian alternative with Lévy increments. Out-of-sample backtesting results show good performance wrt burn analysis employing smooth Market Price of Risk (MPR) estimates based on NASDAQ weekly and monthly German wind power futures prices and German wind power utilisation as underlying. A seasonal MPR of a smile-shape is observed, with positive values in times of high volatility, e.g. winter months, and negative values, in times of low volatility and production, e.g. in summer months. We conclude that producers pay premiums to insure stable revenue steams, while investors pay premiums when weather risk is high.

Abstract: Cryptocurrencies have left the dark side of the finance universe and become an object of study for asset and portfolio management. Since they have a low liquidity compared to traditional assets, one needs to take into account liquidity issues when one puts them into the same portfolio. We propose use a LIquidity Bounded Risk-return Optimization (LIBRO) approach, which is a combination of the Markowitz framework under the liquidity constraints. The results show that cryptocurrencies add value to a portfolio and the optimization approach is even able to increase the return of a portfolio and lower the volatility risk.

Abstract: This paper contributes to model the industry interconnecting structure in a network context. General predictive model (Rapach et al. 2016) is extended to quantile LASSO regression so as to incorporate tail risks in the construction of industry interdependency networks. Empirical results show a denser network with heterogeneous central industries in tail cases. Network dynamics demonstrate the variety of interdependency across time. Lower tail interdependency structure gives the most accurate out-of-sample forecast of portfolio returns and network centrality-based trading strategies seem to outperform market portfolios, leading to the possible too central to fail argument.

Abstract: This paper reviews the performance of the East German economy in the turbulent quarter-century following reuni?cation and draws some conclusions for the reuni?cation of North and South Korea. In this period, the gap in output per capita between East and West Germany declined at a speed not far from empirical estimates of the neoclas- sical growth model, yet systematic total factor productivity di¤eren- tials persist despite identical institutional frameworks and signi?cant investment in the eastern regions. At the same time, regional dispar- ities in income, well-being, and health are little di¤erent from those found within West Germany, and net migration has ceased. On this human metric, German uni?cation has been an unquali?ed success. For Korea, an e¤ort of this dimension will be costly. A back-of-the- envelope calculation suggests that Korean uni?cation will cost roughly twice as much as its German counterpart.

Abstract: This paper proposes a test for missing at random (MAR). The MAR assumption is shown to be testable given instrumental variables which are independent of response given potential outcomes. A nonparametric testing procedure based on integrated squared distance is proposed. The statistics asymptotic distribution under the MAR hypothesis is derived. In particular, our results can be applied to testing missing completely at random (MCAR). A Monte Carlo study examines finite sample performance of our test statistic. An empirical illustration analyzes the nonresponse mechanism in labor income questions.

Abstract: The interdependence, dynamics and riskiness of financial institutions are the key features frequently tackled in financial econometrics. We propose a Tail Event driven Network Quantile Regression (TENQR) model which addresses these three aspects. More precisely, our framework captures the risk propagation and dynamics in terms of a quantile (or expectile) autoregression involving network effects quantified through an adjacency matrix. To reflect the nature and risk content of systemic risk, the construction of the adjacency matrix is suggested to include tail event covariates. The model is evaluated using the SIFIs (systemically important financial institutions) identified by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) as main players in the global financial system. The risk decomposition analysis of it identifies the systemic importance of SIFIs and thus provides measures for the required level of additional loss absorbency. It is discovered that the network effect, as a function of the tail probability, becomes more profound in stress situations and brings the various impacts to the SIFIs located in different geographic regions.

Abstract: In this paper we propose a new measure for systemic risk: the Financial Risk Meter (FRM). This measure is based on the penalization parameter () of a linear quantile lasso regression. The FRM is calculated by taking the average of the penalization parameters over the 100 largest US publicly traded financial institutions. We demonstrate the suitability of this risk measure by comparing the proposed FRM to other measures for systemic risk, such as VIX, SRISK and Google Trends. We find that mutual Granger causality exists between the FRM and these measures, which indicates the validity of the FRM as a systemic risk measure. The implementation of this project is carried out using parallel computing, the codes are published on www.quantlet.de with keyword FRM. The R package RiskAnalytics is another tool with the purpose of integrating and facilitating the research, calculation and analysis methods around the FRM project.

Abstract: Systemically important banks are connected and have dynamic dependencies of their default probabilities. An extraction of default factors from cross-sectional credit default swaps (CDS) curves allows to analyze the shape and the dynamics of the default probabilities. Extending the Dynamic Nelson Siegel (DNS) model, we propose a network DNS model to analyze the interconnectedness of default factors in a dynamic fashion, and forecast the CDS curves. The extracted level factors representing long-term default risk demonstrate 85.5% total connectedness, while the slope and the curvature factors document 79.72% and 62.94% total connectedness for the short-term and middle-term default risk, respectively. The issues of default spillover and systemic risk should be weighted for the market participants with longer credit exposures, and for regulators with a mission to stabilize financial markets. The US banks contribute more to the long-run default spillover before 2012, whereas the European banks are major default transmitters during and after the European debt crisis either in the long-run or short-run. The outperformance of the network DNS model indicates that the prediction on CDS curve requires network information. Key Words:  CDS, network, default risk, variance decomposition, risk management

Abstract: More and more data are observed in form of curves. Numerous applications in finance, neuroeconomics, demographics and also weather and climate analysis make it necessary to extract common patterns and prompt joint modelling of individual curve variation. Focus of such joint variation analysis has been on fluctuations around a mean curve, a statistical task that can be solved via functional PCA. In a variety of questions concerning the above applications one is more interested in the tail asking therefore for tail event curves (TEC) studies. With increasing dimension of curves and complexity of the covariates though one faces numerical problems and has to look into sparsity related issues. Here the idea of FActorisable Sparse Tail Event Curves (FASTEC) via multivariate asymmetric least squares regression (expectile regression) in a high-dimensional framework is proposed. Expectile regression captures the tail moments globally and the smooth loss function improves the convergence rate in the iterative estimation algorithm compared with quantile regression. The necessary penalization is done via the nuclear norm. Finite sample oracle properties of the estimator associated with asymmetric squared error loss and nuclear norm regularizer are studied formally in this paper. As an empirical illustration, the FASTEC technique is applied on fMRI data to see if individuals risk perception can be recovered by brain activities. Results show that factor loadings over different tail levels can be employed to predict individuals risk attitudes.

Abstract: Cryptocurrencies are more and more used in official cash  ows and exchange of goods. Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology have been looked at by big companies that are adopting and investing in this technology. The CRIX Index of cryptocurrencies hu.berlin/CRIX indicates a wider acceptance of cryptos. One reason for its prosperity certainly being a security aspect, since the underlying network of cryptos is decentralized. It is also unregulated and highly volatile, making the risk assessment at any given moment difficult. In message boards one nds a huge source of information in the form of unstructured text written by e.g. Bitcoin developers and investors. We collect from a popular crypto currency message board texts, user information and associated time stamps. We then provide an indicator for fraudulent schemes. This indicator is constructed using dynamic topic modelling, text mining and unsupervised machine learning. We study how opinions and the evolution of topics are connected with big events in the cryptocurrency universe. Furthermore, the predictive power of these techniques are investigated, comparing the results to known events in the cryptocurrency space. We also test hypothesis of self-fulling prophecies and herding behaviour using the results. Key Words:  Dynamic Topic Modelling, Cryptocurrencies, Financial Risk

Abstract: It is a challenging task to understand the complex dependency structures in an ultra-high dimensional network, especially when one concentrates on the tail dependency. To tackle this problem, we consider a network quantile autoregres- sion model (NQAR) to characterize the dynamic quantile behavior in a complex system. In particular, we relate responses to its connected nodes and node spe- cic characteristics in a quantile autoregression process. A minimum contrast estimation approach for the NQAR model is introduced, and the asymptotic properties are studied. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of our model by in- vestigating the nancial contagions in the Chinese stock market accounting for shared ownership of companies.

Abstract: In the present paper we study the dynamics of penalization parameter ? of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method proposed by Tibshirani (1996) and extended into quantile regression context by Li and Zhu (2008). The dynamic behaviour of the parameter ? can be observed when the model is assumed to vary over time and therefore the fitting is performed with the use of moving windows. The proposal of investigating time series of ? and its dependency on model characteristics was brought into focus by H¨ardle et al. (2016), which was a foundation of FinancialRiskMeter (http://frm.wiwi.hu-berlin.de). Following the ideas behind the two aforementioned projects, we use the derivation of the formula for the penalization parameter ? as a result of the optimization problem. This reveals three possible effects driving ?; variance of the error term, correlation structure of the covariates and number of nonzero coefficients of the model. Our aim is to disentangle these three effect and investigate their relationship with the tuning parameter ?, which is conducted by a simulation study. After dealing with the theoretical impact of the three model characteristics on ?, empirical application is performed and the idea of implementing the parameter ? into a systemic risk measure is presented.

Abstract: Crypto-currencies have developed a vibrant market since bitcoin, the rst crypto-currency, was created in 2009. We look at the properties of cryptocurrencies as nancial assets in a broad cross-section. We discuss approaches of altcoins to generate value and their trading and information platforms. Then we investigate crypto-currencies as alternative investment assets, studying their returns and the co-movements of altcoin prices with bitcoin and against each other. We evaluate their addition to investors' portfolios and document they are indeed able to enhance the diversication of portfolios due to their little co-movements with established assets, as well as with each other. Furthermore, we evaluate pure portfolios of crypto-currencies: an equallyweighted one, a value-weighted one, and one based on the CRypto-currency IndeX (CRIX). The CRIX portfolio displays lower risk than any individual of the liquid crypto-currencies. We also document the changing characteristics of the crypto-currency market. Deepening liquidity is accompanied by a rise in market value, and a growing number of altcoins is contributing larger amounts to aggregate crypto-currency market capitalization.

Abstract: The increasing exposure to renewable energy has amplied the need for risk management in electricity markets. Electricity price risk poses a major challenge to market participants. We propose an approach to model and fore- cast electricity prices taking into account information on renewable energy production. While most literature focuses on point forecasting, our method- ology forecasts the whole distribution of electricity prices and incorporates spike risk, which is of great value for risk management. It is based on func- tional principal component analysis and time-adaptive nonparametric density estimation techniques. The methodology is applied to electricity market data from Germany. We nd that renewable infeed eects both, the location and the shape of spot price densities. A comparison with benchmark methods and an application to risk management are provided.

Abstract: There are many environments in econometrics which require nonseparable modeling of a structural disturbance. In a nonseparable model, key conditions are validity of instrumental variables and monotonicity of the model in a scalar unobservable. Under these conditions the nonseparable model is equivalent to an instrumental quantile regression model. A failure of the key conditions, however, makes instrumental quantile regression potentially inconsistent. This paper develops a methodology for testing the hypothesis whether the instrumental quantile regression model is correctly specied. Our test statistic is asymptotically normally distributed under correct specication and consistent against any alternative model. In addition, test statistics to justify model simplication are established. Finite sample properties are examined in a Monte Carlo study and an empirical illustration.

Abstract: Limit order book contains comprehensive information of liquidity on bid and ask sides. We propose a Vector Functional AutoRegressive (VFAR) model to describe the dynamics of the limit order book and demand curves and utilize the tted model to predict the joint evolution of the liquidity demand and supply curves. In the VFAR framework, we derive a closed-form maximum likelihood estimator under sieves and provide the asymptotic consistency of the estimator. In application to limit order book records of 12 stocks in NASDAQ traded from 2 Jan 2015 to 6 Mar 2015, it shows the VAR model presents a strong predictability in liquidity curves, with  values as high as 98.5 percent for insample estimation and 98.2 percent in out-of-sample forecast experiments. It produces accurate 5????; 25???? and 50????minute forecasts, with root mean squared error as low as 0.09 to 0.58 and mean absolute percentage error as low as 0.3 to 4.5 percent.

Abstract: Mortality is different across countries, states and regions. Several empirical research works however reveal that mortality trends exhibit a common pattern and show similar structures across populations. The key element in analyzing mortality rate is a time-varying indicator curve. Our main interest lies in validating the existence of the common trends among these curves, the similar gender differences and their variability in location among the curves at the national level. Motivated by the empirical findings, we make the study of estimating and forecasting mortality rates based on a semi-parametric approach, which is applied to multiple curves with the shape-related nonlinear variation. This approach allows us to capture the common features contained in the curve functions and meanwhile provides the possibility to characterize the nonlinear variation via a few deviation parameters. These parameters carry an instructive summary of the time-varying curve functions and can be further used to make a suggestive forecast analysis for countries with barren data sets. In this research the model is illustrated with mortality rates of Japan and China, and extended to incorporate more countries.

Abstract: The S&0 or DA are important benchmarks for the financial industry. These and other indices describe different compositions of certain segments of the financial markets. For currency markets, the IMF offers the index SDR. Prior to the Euro, the ECU existed, which was an index representing the development of European currencies. It is surprising, though, to see that the common index providers have not mapped emerging e-coins into an index yet because with cryptos like Bitcoin, a new kind of asset of great public interest has arisen. Index providers decide on a fixed number of index constituents which will represent the market segment. It is a huge challenge to set this fixed number and develop the rules to find the constituents, especially since markets change and this has to be taken into account. A method relying on the AIC is proposed to quickly react to market changes and therefore enable us to create an index, referred to as CRIX, for the cryptocurrency market.

Abstract: Publications are a vital element of any scientists career. It is not only the number of media outlets but aslo the quality of published research that enters decisions on jobs, salary, tenure, etc. Academic ranking scales in economics and other disciplines are, therefore, widely used in classification, judgment and scientific depth of individual research. These ranking systems are competing, allow for different disciplinary gravity and sometimes give orthogonal results. Here a statistical analysis of the interconnection between Handelsblatt (HB), Research Papers in Economics (RePEc, here RP) and Google Scholar (GS) systems is presented. Quantile regression allows us to successfully predict missing ranking data and to obtain a so-called HB Common Score and to carry out a cross-rankings analysis. Based on the merged ranking data from different data providers, we discuss the ranking systems dependence, analyze the age effect and study the relationship between the research expertise areas and the ranking performance.

Abstract: This paper reviews the dramatic and widely noted developments in the German labor market in the past decade and surveys the most plausible reasons for these changes. Alternative hypotheses are compared and contrasted. I argue that the labor market reforms associated with the Agenda 2010  the Hartz reforms  played a role at least as great as that of increasing flexibility of wage determination and the allocation of hours across workers. Until 2010, the German economic miracle could be accounted for by an expansion of part-time work, which has since been supplanted by a sustained expansion of full-time employment. Supported by wage flexibility in this segment, part-time employment represents an important new margin of flexibility in the German labor market.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the statistical properties of the moneyness scaling transformation by Leung and Sircar (2015). This transformation adjusts the moneyness coordinate of the implied volatility smile in an attempt to remove the discrepancy between the IV smiles for levered and unlevered ETF options. We construct bootstrap uniform confidence bands which indicate that in a statistical sense there remains a possibility that the implied volatility smiles are still not the same, even after moneyness scaling has been performed. This presents possible arbitrage opportunities on the (L)ETF market which can be exploited by traders. We build possible arbitrage strategies by constructing portfolios with LETF shares and options which possibly have a positive value at the point of creation and non-negative value at the expiration time. An empirical data application shows that there are indeed such opportunities in the market which result in risk-free gains for the investor. A dynamic "trade-with-the-smile" strategy based on a dynamic semiparametric factor model is presented. This strategy utilizes the dynamic structure of implied volatility surface allowing out-of-sample forecasting and information on unleveraged ETF options to construct theoretical one-step-ahead implied volatility surfaces.

Abstract: In this paper, we suggest and analyze a new class of specification tests for random coefficient models. These tests allow to assess the validity of central structural features of the model, in particular linearity in coefficients and generalizations of this notion like a known nonlinear functional relationship. They also allow to test for degeneracy of the distribution of a random coefficient, i.e., whether a coefficient is fixed or random, including whether an associated variable can be omitted altogether. Our tests are nonparametric in nature, and use sieve estimators of the characteristic function. We analyze their power against both global and local alternatives in large samples and through a Monte Carlo simulation study. Finally, we apply our framework to analyze the specification in a heterogeneous random coefficients consumer demand model.

Abstract: We account for time-varying parameters in the conditional expectile based value at risk (EVaR) model. EVaR appears more sensitive to the magnitude of portfolio losses compared to the quantile-based Value at Risk (QVaR), nevertheless, by fitting the models over relatively long ad-hoc fixed time intervals, research ignores the potential time-varying parameter properties. Our work focuses on this issue by exploiting the local parametric approach in quantifying tail risk dynamics. By achieving a balance between parameter variability and modelling bias, one can safely fit a parametric expectile model over a stable interval of homogeneity. Empirical evidence at three stock markets from 2005- 2014 shows that the parameter homogeneity interval lengths account for approximately 1-6 months of daily observations. Our method outperforms models with one-year fixed intervals, as well as quantile based candidates while employing a time invariant portfolio protection (TIPP) strategy for the DAX portfolio. The tail risk measure implied by our model finally provides valuable insights for asset allocation and portfolio insurance.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimation of a nonparametric regression function from selectively observed data when selection is endogenous. Our approach relies on independence between covariates and selection conditionally on potential outcomes. Endogeneity of regressors is also allowed for. In both cases, consistent two-step estimation procedures are proposed and their rates of convergence are derived. Also pointwise asymptotic distribution of the estimators is established. In addition, we propose a nonparametric specification test to check the validity of our independence assumption. Finite sample properties are illustrated in a Monte Carlo simulation study and an empirical illustration.

Abstract: Inflation expectation is acknowledged to be an important indicator for policy makers and financial investors. To capture a more accurate real-time estimate of inflation expectation on the basis of financial markets, we propose an arbitrage-free model across different countries in a multi-maturity term structure, where we first estimate inflation expectation by modelling the nominal and inflation-indexed bond yields jointly for each country. The Nelson-Siegel model is popular in fitting the term structure of government bond yields, the arbitrage-free model we proposed is the extension of the arbitrage-free dynamic Nelson-Siegel model proposed by Christensen, Diebold and Rudebusch (2011). We discover that the extracted common trend for inflation expectation is an important driver for each country of interest. Moreover, the model will lead to an improved forecast in a benchmark level of inflation and will provide good implications for financial markets.

Abstract: More and more companies start offering digital payment systems. Smartphones evolve to a digital wallet such that it seems like we are about to enter the era of digital finance. In fact we are already inside an digital economy. The market of e-x (x = "finance", "money", "book", you name it . . . ) has not only picked up enormous momentum but has become standard for driving innovative activities of the global economy. A few clicks at y and payment at z brings our purchase to location w. Own currencies for the digital market were therefore just a matter of time. The idea of the Nobel Laureate Hayek, see [1], to let companies offer concurrent currencies seemed for a long time scarcely probabilistic, but the invention of the Blockchain made it possible to fill his vision with life. Cryptocurrencies (abbr. cryptos) came up and widened the angle towards this new level of economic interaction. Since bitcoins appearance a bunch of new cryptos spread the web and offered new ways of proliferation. The crypto market then fanned out and showed clear signs of acceptance and deep liquidity so that one has to look closer at the general moves and dynamics.

Abstract: A flexible framework for the analysis of tail events is proposed. The framework contains tail moment measures that allow for Expected Shortfall (ES) estimation. Connecting the implied tail thickness of a family of distributions with the quantile and expectile estimation, a platform for risk assessment is provided. ES and implications for tail events under different distributional scenarios are investigated, particularly we discuss the implications of increased tail risk for mixture distributions. Empirical results from the US, German and UK stock markets, as well as for the selected currencies indicate that ES can be successfully estimated on a daily basis using a one-year time horizon across different risk levels.

Abstract: Classical asset allocation methods have assumed that the distribution of asset returns is smooth, well behaved with stable statistical moments over time. The distribution is assumed to have constant moments with e.g., Gaussian distribution that can be conveniently parameterised by the first two moments. However, with market volatility increasing over time and after recent crises, asset allocators have cast doubts on the usefulness of such static methods that registered large drawdown of the portfolio. Others have suggested dynamic or synthetic strategies as alternatives, which have proven to be costly to implement. The authors propose and apply a method that focuses on the left tail of the distribution and does not require the knowledge of the entire distribution, and may be less costly to implement. The recently introduced TEDAS -Tail Event Driven ASset allocation approach determines the dependence between assets at tail measures. TEDAS uses adaptive Lasso based quantile regression in order to determine an active set of portfolio elements with negative non-zero coefficients. Based on these active risk factors, an adjustment for intertemporal dependency is made. The authors extend TEDAS methodology to three gestalts differing in allocation weights determination: a Cornish-Fisher Value-at-Risk minimization,  Markowitz diversification rule and naive equal weighting. TEDAS strategies significantly outperform other widely used allocation approaches on two asset markets: German equity and Global mutual funds.

A standard quantitative method to access credit risk employs a factor model based on joint multi- variate normal distribution properties. By extending a one-factor Gaussian copula model to make a more accurate default forecast, this paper proposes to incorporate a state-dependent recovery rate into the con- ditional factor loading, and model them by sharing a unique common factor. The common factor governs the default rate and recovery rate simultaneously and creates their association implicitly. In accordance with Basel III, this paper shows that the tendency of default is more governed by systematic risk rather than idiosyncratic risk during a hectic period. Among the models considered, the one with random fac- tor loading and a state-dependent recovery rate turns out to be the most superior on the default prediction.

Abstract We propose the use of a local autoregressive (LAR) model for adaptive estimation and forecasting of three of Chinas key macroeconomic variables: GDP growth, inflation and the 7-day interbank lending rate. The approach takes into account possible structural changes in the data-generating process to select a local homogeneous interval for model estimation, and is particularly well-suited to a transition economy experiencing ongoing shifts in policy and structural adjustment. Our results indicate that the proposed method outperforms alternative models and forecast methods, especially for forecast horizons of 3 to 12 months. Our 1-quarter ahead adaptive forecasts even match the performance of the well-known CMRC Langrun survey forecast. The selected homogeneous intervals indicate gradual changes in growth of industrial production driven by constant evolution of the real economy in China, as well as abrupt changes in interestrate and inflation dynamics that capture monetary policy shifts.

Based on the Lee-Carter (LC) model, the benchmark in population forecasting, a variety of extensions and modifications are proposed in this paper. We investigate one of the extensions, the Hyndman-Ullah (HU) method and apply it to Asian demographic data sets: China, Japan and Taiwan. It combines ideas of functional principal component analysis (fPCA), nonparametric smoothing and time series analysis. Based on this stochastic approach, the demographic characteristics and trends in different Asian regions are calculated and compared. We illustrate that China and Japan exhibited a similar demographic trend in the past decade. We also compared the HU method with the LC model. The HU method can explain more variation of the demographic dynamics when we have data of high quality, however, it also encounters problems and performs similarly as the LC model when we deal with limited and scarce data sets, such as Chinese data sets due to the substandard quality of the data and the population policy.

We propose a semiparametric measure to estimate systemic interconnectedness across financial institutions based on tail-driven spill-over effects in a ultra-high dimensional framework. Methodologically, we employ a variable selection technique in a time series setting in the context of a single-index model for a generalized quantile regression framework. We can thus include more financial institutions into the analysis, to measure their interdependencies in tails and, at the same time, to take into account non-linear relationships between them. A empirical application on a set of 200 publicly traded U. S. nancial institutions provides useful rankings of systemic exposure and systemic contribution at various stages of financial crisis. Network analysis, its behaviour and dynamics, allows us to characterize a role of each sector in the financial crisis and yields a new perspective of the nancial markets at the U. S. financial market 2007 - 2012. Keywords: Systemic Risk, Systemic Risk Network, Generalized Quantile, Quantile Single- Index Regression, Value at Risk, CoVaR, Lasso

We analyse the short-term spot price of European Union Allowances (EUAs), which is of particular importance in the transition of energy markets and for the development of new risk management strategies. Due to the characteristics of the price process, such as volatility persistence, breaks in the volatility process and heavy-tailed distributions, we investigate the use of Markov switching GARCH (MS-GARCH) models on daily spot market data from the second trading period of the EU ETS. Emphasis is given to short-term forecasting of prices and volatility. We find that MS-GARCH models distinguish well between two states and that the volatility processes in the states are clearly different. This finding can be explained by the EU ETS design. Our results support the use of MS-GARCH models for risk management, especially because their forecasting ability is better than other Markov switching or simple GARCH models.

A flexible statistical approach for the analysis of time-varying dynamics of transaction data on financial markets is here applied to intra-day trading strategies. A local adaptive technique is used to successfully predict financial time series, i.e., the buyer and the seller-initiated trading volumes and the order flow dynamics. Analysing order flow series and its information content of mini Nikkei 225 index futures traded at the Osaka Securities Exchange in 2012 and 2013, a data-driven optimal length of local windows up to approximately 1-2 hours is reasonable to capture parameter variations and is suitable for short-term prediction. Our proposed trading strategies achieve statistical arbitrage opportunities and are therefore beneficial for quantitative finance practice. multiplicative error models, trading volume, order flow, forecasting

Portfolio selection and risk management are very actively studied topics in quantitative finance and applied statistics. They are closely related to the dependency structure of portfolio assets or risk factors. The correlation structure across assets and opposite tail movements are essential to the asset allocation problem, since they determine the level of risk in a position. Correlation alone is not informative on the distributional details of the assets. By introducing TEDAS -Tail Event Driven ASset allocation, one studies the dependence between assets at different quantiles. In a hedging exercise, TEDAS uses adaptive Lasso based quantile regression in order to determine an active set of negative non-zero coefficients. Based on these active risk factors, an adjustment for intertemporal correlation is made. Finally, the asset allocation weights are determined via a Cornish-Fisher Value-at-Risk optimization. TEDAS is studied in simulation and a practical utility-based example using hedge fund indices. Portfolio optimization, asset allocation, adaptive lasso, quantile regression, value-at-risk

Electricity load forecasts are an integral part of many decision-making pro- cesses in the electricity market. However, most literature on electricity load forecasting concentrates on deterministic forecasts, neglecting possibly impor- tant information about uncertainty. A more complete picture of future demand can be obtained by using distributional forecasts, allowing for a more ecient decision-making. A predictive density can be fully characterized by tail mea- sures such as quantiles and expectiles. Furthermore, interest often lies in the accurate estimation of tail events rather than in the mean or median. We pro- pose a new methodology to obtain probabilistic forecasts of electricity load, that is based on functional data analysis of generalized quantile curves. The core of the methodology is dimension reduction based on functional principal components of tail curves with dependence structure. The approach has sev- eral advantages, such as exible inclusion of explanatory variables including meteorological forecasts and no distributional assumptions. The methodol- ogy is applied to load data from a transmission system operator (TSO) and a balancing unit in Germany. Our forecast method is evaluated against other models including the TSO forecast model. It outperforms them in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and achieves a MAPE of 2:7% for the TSO.
